kqspr9c,"It takes guts. It takes needing to change. It takes wanting to be different. Trauma makes us fearful of change, of new or different. Strangely I held on to pain because it was regular.  I could endure the pain but not the pain of facing the cause. 
After my first EMDR session where I dealt with some of my “easiest “ trauma, I was dying for a drink or 10.  I was so open and vulnerable, defenseless.  But, it got better. You have to be willing to open those locked doors of your heart which is truly scary. Be brave. 
Start on the easy stuff first. Then you will see the way forward.
Just try it, you will survive and maybe even fly."
kqsui75,"I am so glad I got EMDR. For me it helped me most to understand where my triggers come from. My C-PTSD left me with little to no memory of the traumatic events and so I never really knew why certain things triggered me and that made me frustrated and uncomfortable. For example I couldn't handle bad smells. I felt like I needed to escape immediately or clean obsessively, anytime one was near. I never knew why until EMDR helped me unlock the memory of when I was first assaulted. I was in a room that reeked of cat urine and feces. Learning where my triggers came from allowed for me to come at my triggers with a new knowledge. Anytime I smell something bad instead of panicking I ground myself and remind myself I'm not in that room anymore. It's helped me separate the past from the present."
kqt3pis,"For me it was life saving. I couldn’t go outside or even hear some sounds inside without panicking. After 10-15 sessions I was at the stage I could go outside by myself. 

I would say a couple of things, if you don’t lean into it I could see it wouldn’t work. During the sessions I had physical spasm when working through things. The therapist is essential for the success, I had a brilliant one and she really saved me."
kqsvvaj,"I did it and was not prepared for the flood of memories or emotions. I ended up on the floor on all fours dry heaving. Now, I was new to therapy and my therapist was new to EMDR so YMMV."
kqwi1bj,Had PTSD due to childhood trauma and military related trauma. I treated both with EMDR and has made my symptoms more manageable for sure. It also made me capable of talking about it to more than just my therapist. I can actually open to my family about now and I have EMDR in part to thank for that.
kqrxy5r,"I completed it for 1 event. It was HARD. Like, take the whole day to myself hard. But it did wonders for me…totally changed my life"
kqt6niq,"I never understood why it works and I didn’t want to dig too much into it to not lose it effect somehow but after it the trauma I endured just was more bearable.
I know some people who didn’t like it and said they turned out to something else."
kqx02fj,I'm going to be very honest with you. edmr played a role in my ability to not only be able to live today; it helped me overcome what trauma I did remember but let me tell you something. As fantastic as it was and it truly helped — it takes guts.  It absolutely is something you should do but with the general idea that the journey you will be on during and after may be quite profound and allot to take in once you've opened pandora’s box.
kqsougy,"I did a few sessions and the flash EMDR was best but only if I was having a good day mentally, otherwise I’d crash hard after so we’re kinda waiting for the rest of my life to calm down a bit and get me out of crisis mode before trying it again. The one time I had a good session on a good day tho I felt nice and relaxed after like I’d taken a Xanax or something I wanna be able to do it again one day"
kqu0gft,I did it and found it massively helpful. It’s definitely worth giving it a shot to see if it helps!
kqu2ni0,I’ve tried it on two separate occasions w different therapists and it didn’t work for me. I read these comments on how much it’s helped others & wish I had the same experience.
kqxhaao,"Yes, on the recommendation of my therapist. Many of the sessions were very difficult and exhausting (mentally and emotionally) to work through, it wasn’t easy. But it definitely helped me deal with a lot of my trauma win a much healthier way than I had tried to on my own."
ktz78bw,"EMDR has been a savior for me.  I'd not hesitate to recommend it to my friends in need of PTSD help.  My provider uses sound instead of eye-follow-finger etc movement. I close my eyes and find they move naturally to the sound, rather than having to 'follow' something."
kqrpn4r,"It didn't help me at all, but it could help you. If you had single event trauma it can be more effective than multiple events. Also more effective in combat veterans than things like rape"
kqrwu4c,"I have done emdr a lot. 

For some things, it worked really well I think. 

For my long-term CSA, not so much. 

I think it really depends on what you have gone through, how long it lasted. It also depends on other factors, such as how dissociative you are. 

Either way, if you suspect you have or have PTSD, get a trauma informed therapist. If you are interested in emdr, ask them if they practice it. Id also recommend you ask how long they have done it. I was essentially the 1st patient for one of my therapists and yeah... Not a good experience. 

Wishing you the best."
kqscfs4,It is the best decision I ever made. My life is ten thousand times better than it was before I did it. It was very hard. I would do it again. My therapist was extremely experienced and an educator and I honestly believe it saved my life.
kqsshle,"I did it it help very much with the day to day things takes a toll though, so I would request the day that I do it to not be at work, it's exhausting afterwards but it's so so worth it"
kqrxxyz,"i did emdr for several months and it just put me in a constant state of dissociation, to the point where i couldn't tell if i was awake or dreaming 24/7. i had to quit my job and stay home for a long time. 

just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it always won't work though! i've heard great stories of it working wonders for people. i think it's just down to the person and how their brain works."
kqs2wv7,"It made my PTSD symptoms significantly worse, long term. It made my nightmares and flashbacks more vivid. I definitely regret trying it."
kqrzmg2,"it did nothing for me and i hated it, but i also didn’t take it seriously at all."
m0bdpap,"I'm new to it, and it's difficult, but it is helping me after just a few sessions. I had CBT first, and I feel that it gave me tools to help manage the difficult parts along with my EMDR resources."
kquhvtg,"I did it. I went in very skeptical. It was hard. It helped but I’m not sure why. The theory behind EMDR could have been the reason, but I feel like it was just as helpful to ruminate hard on buried memories and then talk about them and it nothing to do with the whole eye movement thing."
lepi5yt,"I did it weekly for several months back in 2019. It worked really well for me. I was felt a little “off” for several days afterwards. My therapist described as my brain refiling all the memories that we brought up and worked through during the session. It allowed me to go into the memories and relive them, without the emotional ties to them. These things happened and they are a part of me. I don’t want to forget them, but I also don’t want the emotions to shut me down or put me in fight or flight like they are happening again. 5 years later and I am doing better than I have ever done both professionally and personally."
les0mh3,I tried it but it didn’t really work well for me. Ketamine assisted therapy changed my life
lep2l6e,"I did 30 sessions of it. It wasn’t the toughest thing I’ve done, it’s challenging but not the toughest thing I’ve ever done by far.

It didn’t really work for me. I have CPTSD and the evidence that it is effective in cases of CPTSD is dubious at best. It seems to work best for single episodes of trauma and not repeated trauma or developmental trauma."
leoju3g,"It did wonders for me, I'm so glad I did it. 

It was also a lot of work, my therapist did months of prep with me to make it as safe a space as possible but there were a couple of times it was too intense and quite upsetting. 

I remember feeling emotionally exhausted after every session. What helped me ease into it was using EMDR to target times where I was triggered by stimulus that if my brain was normal would have been NBD. It worked well because I could usually solve them in 1 session and it was so motivating seeing such a quick progression and they were very unlikely to trigger me again compared to reviewing the Primary event (e.g. using EMDR to review a time I had a panic attack from trying to walk alone at night)."
lerhu4g,I underwent it. Twice a week during Covid so sessions were online. Happened during my work hours. I was drained totally after the sessions and did not have any energy left to work after that. At one point I thought to drop it but I continued. It helped me with my flashbacks and bloody nightmares.
leohyl6,"For me it worked well, but yes, I agree with your psych it is hard. Not the hardest thing I’ve ever done but very intense. I’m still very glad I did it."
lep1heq,"I did it, twice. Once for early childhood trauma and for one I experienced in later life. Amazing results. No issues with driving before or after session at all. Enabled me to deal with a lot of stuff and start living my life in more normal way. Only thing I regret is that I didn't have it earlier."
lesg3e2,It did nothing at all for me except make everything worse. And not the “it gets worse before it gets better” kind of worse
1i0af5s,"I have my first EMDR session later this week. Im not sure what really to say. I know im supposed to work into processing my trauma, but do i just talk about all of it all at once? Will the doc ask me questions? I understand how EMDR works on a large scale, but im super unsure of the details and I cant find any examples online. If someone could share what their forst few sessions were like that would be super helpful. Im already stressing myself out wondering how to bring anything up. I’ve only seen my new therapist twice, so I dont really know him that well yet."
m65gyqs,"I’ve had several EMDR sessions with my Psychologist and it helped me to process certain traumas. This will be a lifetime of healing, but EMDR helped me tremendously.

My EMDR sessions there is no talking. Just me recalling memories in my head while my Psychologist intentionally waves her hand back and forth in front of my eyes and I follow her hands with my eyes. When things get too intense she would ask me what color I was thinking about or another question to pull me out."
kuluxmj,"I have done EMDR about 16/17 years ago and it helped SO much. 



Until I about  2 years ago and I started reliving the trauma but from a different perspective.  (My eldest kid was the same age as when my sister and I were SA and Mt mom 2 years ago told me it was fine to bring my kids around the uncle who SA us. )



I have been back in therapy, and working on EMDR with an AMAZING therapist for the last 6 months. To be honest, it is SO fn hard.




 But, I can and have showered several times recently  without even thinking about it. Which is a HUGE step. No panic attacks, no one has to be in there with me keeping me grounded. I just realized today, that I have been showering with no issues. 



I opened up to my aunt about what is going on, which about as well as you can expect.  But no nightmares or disassociating afterwards.  Which is pretty huge.




Today, I confronted my mom over the phone, who I have not spoken to in about 6 months.  I am, okay. 



There were times when I wanted to unalive myself during this process.  And again,  it is hard af. But, due to being sick for about 6weeks with covid and pneumonia I am off of all my meds and never started back up. 
I am off of my depression/anxiety meds and I am still here and still present me.



I completely recommend EMDR. You should discuss anxiety meds with your therapist and MD prior to beginning.  Also, having a good support team helps. My hubs has been SO extremely helpful and supportive.  I couldn't have done this work without him and his unwavering and unconditional love. (Something I ha e never had. Ever.)



I wish you peace, and healing. Trauma is so hard to heal, and PTSD is forever. But you can get better. It does get better."
kuodttj,"I had  an incredible experience with EMDR, and it saved my life. One of the wildest positive side effects was being able to read again. I had really bad C-PTSD from child abuse, and I hadn't realized how dramatically my ability to read and process information had fallen. It's not that I was illiterate, but the process of taking in new information so overwhelmed by already overwhelmed brain that very little made it in or stuck in my memory. I saw my therapist 3x/week for about 2 years, and we did EMDR at about 1/3 to 1/2 of those sessions. I needed a lot of help. I treated it like a job. This is where I go and what I do so I can live again.   


It's a green flag to me that your provider is recommending this after a year. I needed a strong foundation of trust with my therapist before we started. If you have that, it will likely help.    


If you can, it may help to get curious about what specifically you're afraid of. Getting stuck in the past? Disturbing the tight equilibrium you have found? Something else entirely? Seeing someone's face again? Talking about your reasons with your provider may help you decide.

All the best as you decide! Remember it's ok to take your time and be kind to yourself."
kulhuow,"I did EMDR for more than a year with a wonderful therapist. I DREADED going, and it felt horrible. A few years on, it’s definitely what has helped me the most out of any treatment so far. Really lessened my symptoms when awake. Go for it!! It’s tough to relive, but it changed my life for the better, and with a good therapist, you’ll be safe. I cry sometimes just thinking about how grateful I am for my therapist and what she did for me. Stick with it!! Best of luck"
kulfxxp,"I did it. I'll admit I never looked forward to going into it but it helped tremendously. It sucks because you have to relive stuff, go through it a little at a time. It helped me with my trauma so much though. I couldn't believe it. It felt like a miracle.

Before I would leave the office we (my therapist and me) would go through the ritual of putting that evil box back on the shelf for the time being. I would usually feel a bit more emotional on those days but not bad enough to quit.

 You just have to be willing to take those boxes off the shelf. If you're not ready for that then you're most likely not ready for emdr. 

I will say that I had a really good relationship with my therapist and I felt safe with her. I believe that is something that helps."
kulvlz8,"I saw a therapist for EMDR for several months. We processed memories while I tapped on myself -- my chest or legs. So I would talk about a memory and how I felt and feel while pounding on my chest or legs basically. 

I found some relief from my PTSD triggers for a few months, like my fight/flight wasn't as bad -- it didn't ever disappear.  But that was about it. Things are as bad as ever now, and were within 6 months of having completed the therapy. So I don't feel I have more control. I did like talking about it all though -- getting it all out. YMMV."
kukz0c0,"I found it very draining and it opened boxes in my mind that had been locked away for a long time. This is part of the process in healing whichever therapy you choose but for me some boxes were quite forgotten and unexpected. I then left my session struggling to deal with these new memories and found it all overwhelming and decided EMDR wasn't for me. 

I know several people for whom it has been a game changer though, and would also suggest that trying is perhaps better than continuing to struggle as you are before trying. Just be aware that in cases of multiple traumas, some unrelated to the issues you are attending therapy for, you may discover things you hadn't realised were there. That in itself can either be challenging or more enlightening depending on where you are in your journey. 

All the best with your journey, try everything once because nothing is worse than that feeling of helplessness."
kulqify,"I really appreciated being able to “rewrite” my past in that i could respond differently to my trauma than i did at the time it occurred. Definitely empowered me and gave me the ability to practice new coping skills by providing distance between me and my trauma. Sometimes trauma seems ever present and new copings skills are hard to establish because the trauma is right in the front of my mind. This allowed me to establish boundaries so I could move forward. Is it a cure all. No. There was and still much to do. However, it gave me a foundation onto which I can build a new home inside myself. Wishing you healing"
kuxdec8,"I‘m not gonna lie, EMDR sessions feel terrible. On the other hand they do really help. A LOT!!!! Listen to the positive feedback provided. Be sure you‘re therapist is certified in EMDR though because it is (at least was a few years ago) not part of regular psychology studies (at least in Germany and the Netherlands; this counts for the bachelor, master as well as the theraphy apprenticeship) and this is something you want your professional to be proficient in!!!!!

Be sure to that your therapist is suggesting EMDR for YOU!
The results of confrontational therapy relies heavily on a lot of factors (competence of the therapist, his/her understanding your problem, your openness to the method, severity of your illness, form of PTSD"
1gpuftl,"I just need some advice from people who have done EMDR. I have CPTSD and became interested in trying EMDR. In the past I have done years of therapy including CBT and talk therapy which focused largely on other tools to cope with my symptoms. I was diagnosed 8 years ago and since have read every single book and article I can get my hands on. The point being that even though I have not specifically done EMDR before, I am certainly not a noob when it comes to trauma therapy in general. 

I started with a new therapist in February. I’m not a huge fan of her’s but she does EMDR so I’ve stuck it out with her. When I first approached her I told her that EMDR was where my interests are focused. Now, I understand that there needs to be some time to set up the groundwork but The problem I’m having is that here we are 10 months into therapy and there is yet to be a single mention of EMDR. Instead we seem to be following a set cookie cutter style of program she created that has me repeating steps and ‘lessons’ I’ve already done like CBT techniques and etc. I’ve expressed my frustration with her but she insists we carry on this way and I just feel like I’m spinning my wheels here. 

So my question is, I know that laying the groundwork for EMDR takes some time but isn’t ten months with no end in sight excessive? "
1ggtv1u,Super short summary but one of the first things we went over was making a safe place in my mind for me to go when things get triggering and overwhelming. I’ve practiced it in passing since (I’ve only been in sessions for a month now) but it hasn’t stuck when I needed it to. Well tonight something happened that triggered me and sent me into a mild panic attack and I tried going to the safe place we created. And it worked!! It took about 5 minutes or so but it helped me calm down a lot and I was able to make myself feel safe again in the safe place I created in my mind and I feel really accomplished right now! 
lrv3n5f,"Yes.  I did it several times.  It was extremely helpful, almost a complete cure.  I highly recommend it."
lrxqaso,"I have PTSD from childhood trauma which stretched into trauma in my adulthood as well. I’ve done DBT and CBT but EMDR has made the biggest impact on my life, health, and treatment. It can get really heavy, sometimes I get vivid dreams about my trauma, and I’ve noticed more intense reactions to my triggers since starting EMDR. It definitely took me a few sessions to get into it and to stop just zoning out on the light but now that I’ve been at it for a while I’ve noticed a significant difference on how I feel, how I process my trauma, and it’s really strengthened my relationship with myself."
1hlqthk,"CW: Car accident (no details of event), description of restrictions I am facing after a surgery (no details of procedure), rage about driver responsible 

TL;DR Has anyone been able to get their PIP (Personal Injury Protection) insurance cover EMDR specifically? I am recovering from surgery I needed as a result of the accident. It has led to hyperarousal and my traditional therapy/meds etc aren’t cutting it. I can’t even bathe without having a meltdown.

**My question is if you have successfully had an EMDR provider bill you personally (give you a detailed statement), submitted it to your MVA insurance, have they agreed to pay for it?**

-I’m finding that most of the EMDR providers in my area (I don’t want to do it online) don’t accept PIP coverage… the only other way I could get them to pay for it is if I get the bill from the provider and send it over to my PIP provider.-

Details, if anyone else can relate or has any advice.

It has been 14 months since the accident. Not only did I have a physical injury, but it was also a total mind F. The driver responsible was uninsured, suspended license, and unregistered vehicle. She committed at least 2 felonies that night in addition to violating several serious traffic laws. She had warrants out for her arrest AND illegal things in her possession (too upsetting to even list).

What was her “punishment”? TWO NIGHTS in jail. She was never charged for anything, and I will be disfigured for life.

The injury I sustained was worse than we initially expected. I was told I needed surgery on my right (dominant) elbow 12 months ago and to prove to my insurance that I was trying everything conservative first, I did all of it but it didn’t get better. It’s a long story but my surgery kept getting pushed out. 

Fast forward to now, I had my surgery 2 weeks ago and recovery has been horrible. I’ve had to keep it elevated and because it is my dominant side, I can’t grip or use a turning motion (like turning a doorknob) for at LEAST 4 more weeks!!!! The healing isn’t going to really end until the end of 2025.

Before the car accident I’ve experienced trauma but this accident caused flashbacks and dissociation for the first time in my life. The worst part is that I’m not even the same person anymore. 

I curse this woman daily. I’m trying to find out what my rights are but it’s very complicated because it was an uninsured motorist so insurance companies will put up even more of a fight because it’ll be a total loss.

Anyway if you got this far, thanks for reading.

1dwrg50,"Hi, I was diagnosed with ptsd and depression in 2018. And I tried emdr and cbt. Emdr did absolutely nothing but make me feel worse, so my psychologist told me she couldn't help me further. And every other therapist/psychologist I went to after keeps pushing emdr. So at this point I don't know what to do anymore. I feel frustrated and disappointed that it didn't work for me since everyone I talk to keeps telling me it is the only way.

Please tell me there are other ways to get better, or to get a grip on things. Thanks."
1d2pud6,"DISCLAIMER: i am NOT asking for a diagnosis. advice only please :) 

so in the past, i haven’t qualified for ptsd/c-ptsd. however, i think i do now. i’ve been through several traumas, as i’m very emotionally sensitive. i asked my emdr therapist if she thinks i have ptsd, and she said “well any trauma is ptsd. do you want to have another diagnosis?” i know she meant well, i just like having that answer/conclusion if that makes sense. thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!! "
1erdgo6,"Hey all- a few years ago I did emdr over a very violent/graphic event stemming from my abusive ex. The emdr definitely eased the queasy gore-elements. I was able to feel safe when remembering the event, which is what I wanted. As I’m getting deeper into therapy (with a new therapist) I’m realizing that I also have the feeling of being unloveable, and that memory tends to pop up when I think of what I associate with being unlovable. 


Is this evidence of not fully having processed the original memory, or is it normal to do emdr multiple times to target many different beliefs that a traumatic event instilled? Is it worth searching for other memories of feeling unlovable before targeting the already-targeted memory?
Any advice is appreciated. Thank you! "
1d966k5,"So I start EMDR therapy in one week. The most trauma work I've ever done is one session where I had to go from the beginning of the day to the next morning surrounding my childhood sexual abuse. It made my PTSD waaaay worse and caused a lot of problems. I've heard good things about EMDR but I'm nervous for how it'll go.

Does anyone have any experience with EMDR? What really is it? Does it work? How long does it take? Anything I should know?

Thanks in advance

Parker"
1d7s9mc,"I'm new to PTSD recovery, but I have experienced it for 17 years.

I read The Body Keeps the Score and find that EMDR & DBT is needed to recover from my unresolved trauma. 

So skimming through the therapist list, I saw some noting that they are from an EMDR association or an acredited EMDR practitioner.

Is there a difference in expectation with and without this?"
1d12j87,"I have been in the process of working through my childhood traumas with the use of EMDR for the past few months. I have found a procedure called a Stellate Ganglion Block that I would like to pursue to help reset my nervous system because I feel like I have been stuck in fight/flight/freeze for months now.

If I get the SGB, would it affect my EMDR treatment? I don’t want to ruin that experience with a procedure that may or may not work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
1cj9w0f,"Naltrexone and EMDR

Has anyone been put on this drug to help avoid disassociating during EMDR? My psychiatrist wants me to take 70mg 1 hour before my psychologist does an emdr session.

When we first tried EMdR I became a big mess and was disassociating and all over the place and it was not pleasant. Can anyone tell me about their experience with this ? Any side effects? I’m very sensitive to medications and have ad loads of nasty side effects in the past while trying to find the right ones so I’m very nervous for this. Thanks!"
1awzz7v,"Had my first session this week… Holy shit that was rough and we just started with episode one. 😂 I went from anxious, to tearful (I don’t cry so that was a very vulnerable moment-I didn’t like it lol), to uncomfortable/uneasy/ashamed, to fucking outraged. 

Fuck I knew reliving my childhood sexual abuse would be tough but FUCK! Like part of me keeps think, “Idk if I can do this.” but I also want to continue because I need to face this… But the emotional rollercoaster kind of scared me. I am very emotionally blunted so my body going through that, outside my control, in front of someone is hard. "
1acclnl,"I’ve only been in therapy for a couple months. The therapist doesn’t want to start emdr yet because they are afraid I will isolate myself. At first I just felt like, this is just another thing I’m failing at. But I’m realizing that this is making me more trusting. Maybe this person is actually trying to keep me safe. Has anyone felt the same? 

Side note, I didn’t drink last night to try and cover up how bad I feel. So day two in on that front."
1ba9vna,"so i know there’s probably not a lot of professionals on here and i’ve only done one session so far, but i just wanted to have a second, more educated opinion.

at my last session, we looked into some sexual trauma i had from when i was younger. after that. we looked into some things with my dad, which i’ve been thinking about a lot since.

a few months ago my dads now ex girlfriend opened up to me about how he had been sexually violent when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. this triggered a very unsettled feeling about my dad. ever since then, i’ve had the same feelings about him as i have my past abusers and felt like he’d done something to me. when i first started exploring my sexuality, looking back, there were some things that pointed in the direction of having been penetrated in one way or another before. when i was younger (7 i believe,) i had a friend who raped me, but not probably doing enough to cause any real damage.

when i did emdr, we looked at a time my father was walking towards me with a weird grin on his face, but i’m not sure what happened after that. i have an overwhelming feeling that he’d done something to me that day, but i still feel like i made it up. i can’t tell if finding out about my step mom triggered it or gave me the idea and it formed into a false memory.

my therapist said that he was “innocent until proven guilty” but with my body and some things he’s said and done that i do know of, maybe it is a possibility? "
1b44g2a,"Possible trigger: non consensual non sexual touching

I’m having memories come up that I haven’t thought of in a long time or at all after my last emdr session. 

I tried to plug my ears today bc I’m a mom and partner and dog mom and felt overstimulated. 

That made me remember that he used to stick his fingers in my ears. That rolled into other ways he used to rough house with me and claim it was teaching me self defense. Like I remember how he felt on my body. 

He always had a reason to be touching me. Is that normal of a step parent? Am I just over sensitive? I have step kids, I don’t grab and touch them unless they ask for a hug. I never would think to do what was done to me. "
1aunqd5,So I was diagnosed with PTSD after getting rear ended by a drunk driver . Rear ended so hard It pushed me into the first lane of the highway . I had to get out of my car while it was moving so I wouldn’t get hit by the traffic that was about to come & I saw my car literally crash into the ditch across the highway it was terrifying and has haunted me since I was 21. Now at 29 with a different car I still have panic attacks with driving and can barely make it past 5 minutes of driving without being in crippling panic or having a flashback of my wreck or the other times I had panic attacks. So I went out on a date the other day with a man in his late 40s. And he picked me up the date was going well because he was saying how pretty I was and how amazing I was at conversation then he starts talking about the therapy he’s in for his mental health issues. Then I started telling him about my EMDR therapy for my car accident and he looked at me like I was an alien. And he even asked for the check and then once we back to his car he started saying “ you expect me to drive 40 mins all the time to see you for your fears” . I started crying and saying “ you don’t understand how crippling this is for my daily life I hate too”. Then without any emotion he flat out said “ he wanted a partnership not another job “ and took me home. I blocked his number and cried my eyes out. Why are other PTSD havers more acceptable especially veterans but not people who went through terrifying car accidents?  So I don’t deserve love because my panic attacks & PTSD cripple me from driving 😩
1hbcs1y,"I’m 30F, experienced a wild number of traumas during my childhood but the worst and most prominent one was when I was 16. 

I didn’t go to therapy until I was 26, went for 10 months, did EMDR and it helped take the edge off. I thought I was fixed. 

That was until I started fucking up at work. Doing things I SWEAR I didn’t do, or not doing things I swear I did do, but was proven otherwise by my boss. Scared of my own head, I sought out ADHD testing, seeing as I matched almost every trending symptom of this disorder. 

Not only did I not get diagnosed with ADHD, but my tests had so many “validity” issues that the psychologist diagnosed me with severe PTSD and persistent depression, and recommended that I find a PhD or a PsyD that can potentially diagnose and treat a personality disorder. She said the PTSD is causing cognitive impairments. 

I thought I was fixed. And now I feel 100000x worse than I did before my first attempt at therapy. I feel as though there’s no solution. I’ve recently started a new job, working for myself since that’s better then continually disappointing and fucking things up for others, and I am still screwing things up for my own self. Consistently making really dumb mistakes but not finding out until later. 

Also, can’t find a damn PhD to save my life. So. Not sure where to go from here. Anyone else have this problem? "
1dl7uda,I’m in talk therapy and I feel it’s going nowhere. I’m ready to give up. She wants to medicate me. What can I actually do to heal? I hate sex. It triggers me so bad. I am married and it would ruin the marriage if I stopped having sex. I don’t want to end my marriage . What kind of therapy actually helps you heal? I tried EMDR for a specific incident but not for my overall feelings about sex
1fo3qkd,"I guess this is simultaneously a rant and an open-ended advice post. I’m not sure if anyone else feels the same way but I haven’t found trauma therapy helpful, at all. It feels belittling. I hope I don’t come off as grating or arrogant here, I try to be open minded about therapy because I know it’s me that makes it work, not the method but I will admit I’m a little bitter. 

I’ve been in therapy since I was 11 years old. I got my C-PTSD diagnosis then and I have been trying a different combination of therapies, therapists and medications for 16 years. Out-patient, inpatient, partial hospitalization, residential, group, individual. I’ve tried it. I won’t say I haven’t gotten better at all. Just that none of the progress was thanks to trauma therapy. It feels like therapists only work if you haven’t done any amount of self-reflection. The second I can articulate myself, it’s “wow, you’re very self aware,” and then they tell me they can’t help me.

CBT and DBT are the worst ones. They both start with the premise that I don’t know what a reasonable response is. They both assume I am incapable of reasoning out how I should behave and understanding my emotions. I know what the middle path is and I can recognize when I am feeling overwhelmed. I can preemptively start using a coping skill when I feel stress. However, I am still stuck constantly entering stress responses and desperately trying to use less and less effective coping skills- interrupting my ability to preform basic tasks. They don’t try to process trauma. They just ask me if that’s the “wise mind” talking and tell me to go color a picture. I just bury my trauma deeper until it explodes.

I don’t know if I am cynical or have had multiple bad therapists but EDMR and somatic therapy weren’t great. I heard amazing things about both types of therapies and went in expecting it to be a long, hard process but a rewarding one. The three times I tried it, EMDR sent me into months-long episodes where I couldn’t leave the house. I continued it over telehealth or in-home and I would just get worse after every session. Somatic therapy didn’t really do anything. I actually can’t remark on it because it just didn’t impact me.

Narrative therapy was often combined into others for me but I went back and sought out a specialist, too. It did help bring down the negative reaction I would have when discussing my trauma but trauma is more than the cognitive portion. It left me physically and emotionally volatile but logically self-critical because I just disassociated from the impact of the event itself. As a result, I was referred out to polyvagal therapy and got re-explained the “body keeps the score” concept I had already heard and gained no impactful skills from.

Internal family systems kinda helped me. I did independent workbooks and felt like I really gained insight on how my reactions were my younger self feeling helpless and coming back out. It opened my eyes to ways I could reflect on myself. As a result, I sought out an IFS therapist. The two I tried felt (again) belittling. It wasn’t the processing I had gotten from independent work, it felt like I was right back to my 13 year old self being told that coloring a picture and counting my 5 senses should have fixed things. Radical acceptance helped some when I did independent work, too. That’s not necessarily a therapy methodology and more of a tool you can use for processing, though I have had therapists introduce it.

Most of my improvement I owe to independent worksheets and the medication I’m on- Adderall and Buspar, neither of which are meant for my PTSD because I’m labeled “treatment refractory” and SSRIs conflict with my bipolar. I’m just at a loss. Is this it? Am I stuck constantly entering fight or flight and burying myself in more and more dissociation? Am I unfixable? After 16 years, I’ve fought tooth and nail to be living independently and not hospitalized like I was as a teen. I have been clawing my way out of the hole I was put in and I wish I had a therapist who could help guide me out so I wasn’t shouldering this completely alone. I have faired better since I completely stopped attending therapy but I want so desperately for there to be a professional who won’t tell me I’m too self-aware and already equipped with the skills I need and send me back out alone.

1gjl53y,"Hello, hope everyone is doing well. Sorry if this is against the rules or a stupid post, I will delete it if people want me to.

So I've had a look online at some information about PTSD or CPTSD and in some regards it seems like I might fit, but in other cases I'm not sure. For example, I've never suffered abuse or anything like that, my family are great. So I thought I might share my experience and see if anyone here can offer any advice, if that's okay.

When I was 13, I suddenly got really ill. I would feel like I was gonna be sick almost constantly, no matter what I was doing but I think it might've been worse when I ate. We had a lot of tests, for celiac disease and lactose intolerance, but couldn't figure out what was going on. I dunno how much I weighed but I wasn't eating and my weight dropped. Then after 2 months in December 2013 my appendix ruptured, so it looks like it was that all along.

Not long after that I started having trouble eating, like there was a mental block, it was really difficult every time I ate so I avoided it a lot. Then I started to have OCD symptoms like having routines about everything and obsessing about the possibility of being sick. Things got worse and worse until I had to go into the psychiatric ward in 2015. I was there for 3 months, and by the time I left the eating problems and the OCD seemed to have receded.

But after I left, I realised that I no longer seemed to feel emotions or enjoyment about anything. I don't know when it happened or how or why but at some point while I was at hospital I went from crying every day to now having not cried in over 9 years. I'm just numb all the time, I don't enjoy anything or have any interests or passions or anything. The OCD and eating problems have returned but in slightly different guises, along with depression, and nothing seems to help, not therapy (CBT, TherapyForYou, counselling, group OCD therapy, art psychotherapy and currently seeing a private therapist) or medication (Sertraline, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Vortioxetine and probably others I've forgotten) or anything. I had EMDR but the lady ended up stopping it because it wasn't doing anything. So now I'm stuck, I have no energy or drive to do anything, even the stuff people suggest like exercise or trying new things. I've read about things like the freeze response and it seems to make sense but I don't know what to do about it. 

Sorry for the long post, I didn't know what was worth mentioning and what to omit"
1agbi7e,"I’m a USMC combat veteran (Iraq) I was diagnosed in 2007 with ptsd by the VA. I started receiving health and related benefits in 2014. In the years since I got out I tried to commit suicide 2x. The first was half hearted the second I would’ve succeeded if my friend hadn’t come to my house to check on me. I’ve had a constant 2-3x therapists in my life and have group therapy. I’m on 5x different prescriptions and have a medical marijuana card. I get nightmares 3-4x/ week and the bad ones, when they happen, stop my sleep permanently for that night. I can’t open my blinds at my house, I get triggered almost everyday, I do threat assessments when I’m driving on the road. I can’t be around crowds or people standing behind me, I overreact to just about anything minor and dramatically underreact to any big or major. (A big wreck in front of me, I’m calm as a peach and I run to help/ give first aid. Gas pump malfunctions, I’m punching it as hard as I can and screaming at it.) People wearing baggy clothing draw my complete attention from whatever it was that I’m doing. I have to sit either in a corner or at least with my back to a wall. I can’t trust anyone, I constantly use light discipline, I check the perimeter of my house after nightmares. I’m constantly looking for lies when talking to people. I test everyone quietly to see if they’re going to double cross me. I don’t want to leave this country, crossing an ocean terrifies me, as does public transit stuff. I’ll drive to Oregon for a trip instead of fly with a bunch of people I don’t trust. 

I have failed marriage, then I was engaged (failed), plus 2x women who I’ve lived with (2yrs &  later 4yrs 2016-20) I failed there too. Took a long break after the most recent one (broke up in August 2020) then I started wanting a woman in my life again. First one lasted a few months and she left me to go back to her physically abusive ex. Because she said: “Being with you is too easy, it’s supposed to be much harder than this,” Met another woman who was also in an abusive relationship (mental and emotional). She left for a better life. I was motivated, I devoted myself to giving her the life she deserves. It was hard work, but it was coming back to me too, it was worth it. She moved in and it was 6 weeks of bliss (between us anyway.) Until he started playing dirty with her kids and her family. He started to really weaponize her kids and her family against her. Really cruel stuff. His ransom? “Just come back to me and all of this stops.” We push on together and she tells me she’s not going anywhere and I should start to rely on her (I don’t rely on anyone besides me.) So I do, I really start to allow myself to trust her. She keeps telling me to trust her and lean heavily on her when it comes to my ptsd. So I do, for a couple weeks I felt better than I had in a decade. Then she comes home one day and says she’s going back to him because “I can’t have my kids suffer anymore, I’m terrified of what he’s going to do next.” So here I sit on my couch not wanting to eat, not sleeping, no motivation. She said to rely on her and to count on her. She said she’s not going anywhere, and to trust her (I trust almost no-one) I do. Then she leaves right. After. Telling. Me. She. Wasn’t. 

I’m sure my disability with my mental health has something to do with it. She chose him over me and my ptsd. He was cruel and I was kind, he attacked her and I supported her, he belittled her and I empowered her. In the end all I did was give her the courage to go back to him. 

I give up! I give in, there’s no end to the BS. I can’t get better, I’ve tried equine therapy, EMDR, prolonged exposure, art therapy, music therapy, fitness therapy, yoga therapy. I have 2x psychologists and a group therapy. What do I have to show for it? A failed life, a failed marriage, a failed engagement, and I’ve learned I’m not wanted on this planet. I’ve learned I’m better off hiding in a hole than to show my face. 

I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

Edit: I can’t reach out to family. They’ve told me repeatedly that ptsd is a made up illness. They’ve told me as long as I persist with this delusion I shouldn’t come home or visit for any reason. I haven’t seen my family in 10years. Everytime I call them, they ask me if I still believe I have PTSD. Everytime I say “yes” they then hang up. All of them. 

Update: Thank you all so much for the support! It means the world to me. There’s a lot of good information here that I fully intend to take advantage of. Thank you all!"
1gldwx1,"I won't go into detail. Short version is I had a very traumatic childhood and an extremely abusive mother. I moved out at 17, I did alright for a while, mental health tanked in my mid 20s to the point of being put on disability. Now, at 29, the flashbacks and ptsd episodes are coming in. It's constant as of late, episodes so bad I'm vomiting and screaming and sobbing uncontrollably.

I've been inconsolable for days. No support seems to help. No coping skills help. I feel so lost and alone and hopeless.

Does it hurt this bad forever? Is this what the rest of my life looks like? I'm so scared. I'm so tired."
1i15e7m,"The hypervigilance is killing me. I constantly flinch and scream at any noise and I get scared of everything now. It makes working so exhausting. Additionally, my job requires me to call and talk to people a lot. Yet every single phone call, every single talk I have with a colleague causes severe physiological symptoms (racing heart, panic, trembling, etc. etc.). I'm in therapy but we can't do EMDR atm.

How do you people cope? How can I not feel like I'm dying every time I have to talk to someone? I tried grounding exercises - they help for the moment, but as soon as I stop doing them and think about dialing the number it feels like I'm dying all over again. 

How do you guys do it? I'm honestly so in awe with each and everyone of you 
 "
1h26ypa,"I’m struggling and looking for a support group and women who have a similar story to mine. I’m going through much delayed onset PTSD from an unacknowledged sexual assault that happened 18 years ago. I saw him this summer and it triggered the memory, but it took months for me to uncover, like peeling back layers of an onion. My brain tried so hard to protect me from it, and because I had never acknowledged it as the trauma it was, my memory still existed in fragmented form- emotions separate from the eventual flashbacks (and rape trauma syndrome) that finally came through. The PTSD I experienced (unknowingly) during this time was horrible. I didn’t know what was happening to me. I pushed away my family and friends, even my husband. It could have ended my marriage it was so bad. I am still struggling every day with PTSD. I’ve lost close to 20 pounds and can hardly eat because of the anxiety. Intrusive thoughts are constant. It feels like he is always near me, like he’s haunting me.

I am really struggling to put this back into the past and it has completely upended my life. I’m working with a therapist and doing EMDR which has been helpful. It’s difficult though for me to see a path forward. Because this was so long ago and most of my adult life has happened since then, I cannot conceptualize how to place it back where it belongs. It’s like rewriting my whole life story, in a way.

Does anyone have a similar story?"
1gww6jw,My EMDR therapist today no-showed on me I drove all the way there and he never showed up. I felt abandoned and left. I feel betrayed and angry as he was out of office last week for awhile. A lot happened to me this last week and this week and I wanted to go over that then do my EMDR. But since he no showed on me that obviously didn’t happen idk I just feel fucking awful. 
1h90ld9,"I want a relationship again, but every time I try I shut down. The minute the other person compliments me or admits they feel things for me I turn my emotions off automatically. I can’t stop it. Before this point I could really like the person and be very attracted to them, but every-time they show me love, interested or appreciation I get a little more distant. I’ll try to hang out after I shut down and I feel almost disgusted by them?? I feel horrible and like I’m leading them on cause I truly did like them but it’s like one thing is done or said and that turns me off completely and I feel nothing. And this really applies when my life is stressful in general. It’s almost as if when my life is overwhelming I completely turn off emotions. I feel nothing. The only thing I’m able to feel is anger. I’m angry all the time about anything and everything but mostly my life. I have always been this way from what I’m assuming was protecting myself from my parents (my therapist told me) but I met my ex and for the first time in my life I felt something I felt love, but now I realize it might have been obsession. He hurt me, beyond compare and got me involved in some things I will never forgive myself for. It’s not his fault, I did it no matter how much I thought I felt for him, but I did some god awful things. Now it’s a year later and I’m trying to find out how to feel something again without feeling that I’m the biggest piece of shit that doesn’t deserve love . "
1hsjgoz,"I guess this is a vent? I just don’t talk about this stuff and I suppose telling it to internet strangers might help me digest it. 

I have been a career firefighter/paramedic for 9 years. Love the job but it’s come with a cost. Lots of bad calls just start stacking up. Intrusive “memories” like flashes of scenes or details. I am great at my job and excel on those “bad calls” but afterwards, sometimes months or years later they hit me. My body and mind seem to reject them. The memories are altered. Like they have been redacted. The most obvious and weird part is all of the faces are blurred. I can see the bodies, clothes, scene. I can see what I did (treatment wise) but the face is always blurred. I wouldn’t recognize any of them if they were sitting in my living room. 

I avoid talking about bad calls. I just shake off the intrusive “screenshots” that pop up. But if I can’t immediately shake it off my heart starts to beat harder and faster, my body starts to shake, jaw tensed. It’s not like a bad feeling. I feel like I’m thinking faster, smarter, more observant. Like I’m ready to do work. But it’s exhausting. Because once I reach that heightened state. I’ll be there all day, then not be able to sleep. 

Sleep. I can’t sleep. I’ll lay in bed just wide awake. I’ve turned to alcohol for sleep. It started as a short term fix but now it’s been 15 years. I wouldn’t say I’m an alcoholic. I don’t need to drink. I can easily say no to drinking. But I can’t “unwind” and relax without it. It’s the only thing that gets me to completely relax. Otherwise I’m like “ready to go,” which isn’t a bad thing during the day when I need to get shit done and perform. It has actually been a great tool in my life to excel at my job. I can burn the candle at both ends and really perform at a high level. 

But at night, I just lay there, waiting for the next call. Waiting for something to go wrong so I can go to work. 

I also fought in Afghanistan 2008-2010. I was infantry and got my fair share of “action.” I came back a little fucked up but pushed forward. Now I can’t even begin to go back into those memories without going into that heightened arousal state, then subsequently use alcohol to bring me down. I’ve done my best to leave that part of my life behind me and not “reminisce.”

A guy from the unit I was with wrote a book. “Damn the valley” I bought it and it’s been sitting on my shelf for two years. Unopened. I want to read it but I am worried about the effect it would have on me. How much alcohol I would have to consume to balance it out and stay on the ground. So it sits on the shelf, in plain view but unopened, like all the shit stacked up inside my brain, that I don’t open. 

I guess the “first step” is always admitting there is something wrong. I’ve gone 15 years saying “I’m fine.” Meanwhile adding to the pile of shit locked away in my brain. 

This year I’ve been approached by several of my coworkers and encouraged to go to therapy. One invited me to his garage after shift and we sat and talked about trauma and his experience with EMDR. I started with “I’m good, I don’t need that yet.”And by the end I was holding back as hard as I could to not completely break down.

I guess it’s time to admit that I’m not good. Im not fine. 

I’m pretty fucked up. "
1hcd73p,"Hello all! I've actually been a member of this sub for quite awhile (which I'll expand upon further) but I think this may be my first time posting with my public account. I want to start by saying this is by no means an attempt at self-promotion. I'm a writer and documentarian, and my work (outside of my 9-5) revolves around spotlighting the nuances of trauma and generating awareness. I'm a huge advocate for accessibility, which is why I try to make free resources (like the film I'm about to share) for people like me (TW for CSA).

When I was nineteen, a traumatic memory from my childhood resurfaced...except it didn't, really? I could remember that yes, I had been sexually assaulted; but other than a handful of sensory fragments, there was no storyline. It was extremely jarring--*How can you be haunted by something you can't even remember?* But I soon realized that this phenomenon wasn't only common amongst survivors of childhood trauma (especially CSA), but also completely inline with the nature of trauma and memory. 

I've spent the last four years directing a documentary on the ordeal hoping to highlight this experience, the fallout of recovered memories and the delayed onset of PTSD. While I've screened the film a few times now, today I made it public for the first time, so I wanted to share it with you all in the hopes it may make some people out there feel seen. This subreddit and r/adultsurivors were pretty much my lifeline during that chapter. Nobody around me knew what I was going through, so I relied on the support and kindness of internet strangers. I'm now hoping to pay that forward.

While this is just a draft of the first half, I anticipate wrapping it up in 2025 (I will actually be interviewing trauma expert Dr. Jim Hopper in the coming weeks for this film, who also has some amazing tools about this topic on his website). You can find more about the project and some helpful resources at projectpaperbirds.com! I have been in EMDR for a year and a half now and have made HUGE strides. This is the most stable and happy I've been in my whole life, so healing is possible even in the absence of answers!!! :) If you have any questions about this project or my experiences, I'd be happy to answer.

1htrwmr,"My husband self-claims ptsd.... but after years I'm not sure specifically from what, precisely, besides his father's sudden death when he was 19 (he refuses to tell me how he died, claims I'll use it against him? ... ya me either), and then a few difficult break-ups, divorces. He insists he is not responsible for his triggers and that I should always know better (even in the earlier days when I could objectively definitely not be... bc I didn't know him all that well, really). He used the analogy that if he woke me up with a knife over my head (I got stabbed multiple times in a break-in once, I don't think I hot ptsd from it, though the trauma was intense)... seems to me a false analogy bc that would be intentional, even if he just wanted (in the hypothetical) to tell me how great that knife was in the kitchen (again... ya, me either...?). He blames his nighttime insomnia on things I said (taken out of context by him in many ways) while we were a situationship (at least that's how I saw things, he was apparently ready to fully begin living together despite our then respective spouses etc... I was NOT in a full-on commitment space, didn't think we would ever become a spousal relationship at the time... clearly hd grew on me and that changed; I've only ever tried to be his everything ever since, though I retain certain convictions I believe in). He CAN turn on a dime when frustrated by something small, or being challenged (particularly, by me... no matter how respectfully). He gave me heck tonight for rementionching treatments with high rfficacy rates (emdr, cbt, he microdoses on olanzipan and clonanzipan nightly) etc. got told he's tried them all when he had more money (not in any current budget).... is this ever characteristic of ptsd... or could it allude to a more challenging-to-treat type of personality disorder?

1hu8zif,"This feels a bit idiotic and I've been hesitant about asking other people so excuse me if none of this makes sense. 

I attend to therapy with a PTSD specialist every week but I got stuck in progress because I can't recognize my emotions. On every visit I tell my therapist something then she asks how I feel about them emotionally and I don't have an answer. 

I can recognize when I'm stressed or really uncomfortable but other than that I literally don't know what emotions I feel. Sometimes I'm overcome with different feelings but trying to figure then out is impossible. 

I feel like my therapist is getting impatient with me because of this and she tells me that I need to learn to recognize my emotions, but how do I do that? I know I didn't have much problems with all this when I was a little child but all the years of everything whiped out my old self completely. All the trauma just left my brain blank just the ""survival instincts"". I''m an adult man on the autism spectrum now, it's not like there's too many occasions to talk about emotions on daily basis if I'm sober. 

If I want to recognize my feelings I have to jump through loops to figure them out. Oddly enough I'm great at reading other people's emotions from hints or body language so often I try imagining what somebody else would feel in a situation, then try to logically pinpoint if their emotions could be what I feel. It's weird and my therapist says I'm over thinking everything, but I've got no other way to know what's going on in my brain

I've tried figuring myself out on my own but every time I have to stop and distract myself becausemthe only thing I end up recognizing is fear. I hate all of this, it's confusing and frustrating and I just want to get this over with and get to the next step in therapy"
1hk26gd,"I bought a journal and I'm starting EMDR therapy soon, but is there anything else that would help while I wait? 

I tried meditating to mentally process all of my memories in order from earliest to now, which just gave me a headache and sent me into another derealization episode when I opened my eyes.

I'm sick of Google only suggesting self care and ""~Mindfulness~ UwU"" for literally everything to the point where just seeing that word gets me triggered now unironically.

Like, self care is obviously important, but it's not gonna magically give me closure and make me not a shell of my former self anymore. I try to take good care of myself as much as possible regardless but it always feels like a huge chore.

Where am I supposed to find the motivation for self care if I don't even know or like the person I'm taking care of? I don't have any major goals or dreams in life to work towards which makes self care feel even more pointless. :/

Did you guys adopt any new hobbies or coping skills to try and rebuild? Or did you take on a new identity completely?"
1ht9nq2,"I am proud that I disclosed my past abuse to my mom and sister. I was really scared to do it as I did not want them to be traumatized but they were very supportive. This year I hope to start EMDR therapy and also talk to my other sister and Dad about what happened.

For everyone sharing their story, their struggles - can I just say you should be really proud of yourself for surviving what you went through. I have been having a rough week but remind myself each day that I can get through the day and the time will come when I will heal - not be completely free of the trauma but be at a point when I can function and not have it drag me down. I am hopeful that will happen for everyone else. I am glad we can all support each other."
1hzrsee,I was 8 when it started with a family friend that lived with me. he groomed me. he would play games with me and my xbox with me ( the other games were sexual ) … i tried to back out of it multiple times.. he always came back and he would coerce me and manipulate me. i never wanted it… it was something i always tried to get out of.. he would teach me stuff beg me to do this and then when i would call it out he would gaslight me and blame me. it lasted for 5 years on an off but when it finally ended i was emotionally drained… i ended up moving away i thought things were gonna be good for me but things only got worse i was bullied and isolated at my new school i didn’t know how to handle it.. shame consumed my mind and body… i was ashamed of how i acted during it. my cries for help were ignored… i now know that i have ptsd and that’s why i reacted that way … i just thought something  was wrong me with me like generally wrong i hated myself so bad they reinforced all the feelings he made me feel. My abused lasted for 5 years and the aftermath of it lasted 5 years i’m 18 now and in therapy and i hope i can build a good life
1guqhvb,"Hello. I am 14 F. I got SA'd by 2 teachers, and many strangers and some of them sticked with me. I had multiple profiles so if you'd seen this story or something similar to it it might actually be mine, from a deleted account because some people keep harassing me. 

My SA first happened when I was 10. A history teacher masturbated to me in class whilst sitting next to me. We were so close I felt the back of his hands touching my thigh as he was grabbing his. He touched my waist. I repressed that memory so much I can barely remember his name (I have 2-3 ideas about it.) and I cannot remember his face. I remember what color he was wearing, I remember everything. I found a facebook profile that MIGHT be his. And it makes me feel nauseous.This happened on the weekend, around 10.30 am or something. 

The other one, from 12-13. I stopped taking his lessons 7 months ago, around February. He started from when I had just turned 12 untill I was halfway through 13. My soul his heavy. They both never raped me. But I remember it all. These both happened at something similar to an AP course. So it wasn't at my normal school, just another ""course"" I'd go to in evenings, alone. I took the bus there. Our lessons were from 6.30-8. I still remember everything. He'd talk about puberty a lot. Too much, almost. Weirdly interested in me. Andmy interests. I felt sick, physically sick when he said he could give me the pens his little daughter treasured when I said like stationary. His little daughter, the youngest is a year younger than me. They both never raped me. But I remember how I was afraid to wear a skirt to there when my history teacher touched me. When I finally found the courage to wear a skirt again, then my phisolophy teacher molested me. He said I looked good in a skirt, and laughed. I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling used. I never felt like this 2 years ago. I don't know whats wrong with me. 

I am academically successful and because of the country I live in I got to change cities for highschool. Stayin in an all girls dormitory/hostel. We have a couple relatives in that city that my mom trusts, i don't know them well though. And since I'm most likely going to germany in the summer I'm starting to see my mom less and less and I stopped being able to rely on her like this. I just feel so alone. I wish I was born a boy. I'm not saying boys don't get SA'd I just wish I didn't have to be a girl. I feel like anxiety has its hands wrapped around my neck. I can't breathe. On the outside I seem fine. But in these 2.5 months school has started, I've had these dreams idk how much but enough to drive me crazy. 

And honestly, I'm tired of people using me anyways. 6 months ago I got a DM on instagram after I shared a picture of me on my story. It was a man calling me, I was asleep. He called me around 3.40 am. In the morning, I recieved many pictures. You can guess what it was. I had to immedietly delete my story. Then they asked to see mine. I said no. You might ask why I didn't block him, the reason is whenever these happen I just cannot block immedietly. I'm so furious that I want them to feel the same way I do even though I know they never will. I want my words to get to them even though I know it will never get to them. I said no, I don't want to and I asked him to stop. Then he said I was unfair. I'm so, so tired. Whats unfair..? You used me, and then had the audacity to come and shove it in my face and ask for my pictures... Then tell me they wish they could rape and use me. Not even counting the many different weird and disgusting DM's I got on reddit. 

And honestly, I cannot get this off my chest. No one listens. They think if it wasn't physical its not important. That even made me say I wish I got raped to myself. I was 13 when I said that. I immedietly cried my eyes out because no, I don't want that. I just want people to understand my pain. I was 12 when I took medicines that I thought could make me sick so I didn't have to go to school where I was relentlessly bullied, and then to the courses where I was SA'd. I was 12 when I scratched myself so hard because ""I couldn't get the pain off my chest"" no matter how hard I cried and left small scars on my arms and if you look closely, vertical lines. I'm just very much tired of life. 

And for anyone that might tell me I should atay off social media: my family is literally added on my socials. Except for my tiktok where I literally only use it to watch something, I didn't even customize my account its literally ""User"" something and then numbers. Not even my friends follow me on there. So please, just understand me. 

I'm tired of dreaming about this. I don't want it. I feel like I'm ripped out of my life. Time feels so fast. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. And so violated. I cannot stop wishing for more so maybe I will be taken serious. Even though I know I don't want it in the depths of my heart. I just woke up from a dream where I got gang raped and all I have to say is I'm pretty much really tired. 

English isn't my first language, so if you cannot understand of something I said here, thats pretty normal.

I am also tired of being the one to carry the universal curse of being the daughter. I am the youngest of two, my older brother. He is detached from reality. My parents rely on me. I'm tired of feeling guilty about the things I've accomplished and I am also very tired of being relied on. I feel like I am different from most others my age in a way I cannot explain. I feel like I will never be able to experience teenage love, or anything that I sometimes wish I got to. Everything other than ""being good"" makes me feel guilty. I feel guilty my brother doesn't get to do the things I am doing in life, I feel guilty that I cannot look at any boy that I find cool without a slight feeling of idk, disgust and fear. Anything related to ""love"" whether it is sex or just literally, teenage love where all you do is hold hands and idk walk in the park together makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I feel guilt and shame about the person I've become.

I waited too long to tell anyone, other than my bullies who were once my friends (which wasn't a good idea.) and honestly I had to learn how to function. So I don't think no one realizes/realized how much I am struggling. I seem okay, from the outside and I have a lot of girl friends. I like making friends and I am quite social. I am greatful for everyone in my life, boy or girl but I needed to get this off my chest."
1ak5xs6,"I was an EMT before I could drink a beer. A major Metro area. 16 homicides in one year. Just how do you deal with the dreams? Everynight regardless of sleeping pills or booze they're the same. How do you look at people are normal and not just different. Because they will never understand. The smell of copper pennies. Or the primal screams of mothers. The look in someone's eyes when they die. How are you not alone? How do you not wonder what if you did something different someone else would still be alive. I tried therapy and I literally made one cry. She wanted to know what was bothering me so I told her. And she couldn't handle it. And to be honest I miss it. I would do it all over again. I don't want anyone else to carry the same scars. I just can't forget about it. Years and years later I still think about eyeballs popping out of skulls and babies that feel like a training doll. Just thinking that oh this is just a drill right this isnt actually real. But then realizeing it is when a mother is begging for you to save their baby and just knowing that you can't. I don't know else who could possibly understand. I just I don't know. Even being so far removed from that life I still think about it
 I don't want to it. But I just randomly pops up. Sometimes Im just so angry for no reason. Nobody I know will ever understand. No girlfriend. No job. No dreams will understand. I'm a half a 6 pack of 9.5% beer deep in this already. I just wonder if itll ever be different"
1hwracx,"I am stepping away from an EMDR session because I am too stimulated to continue and frankly I just needed to get this out. I hope in some way it can help you.

I guess three years ago now I was diagnosed with PTSD, ultimately that was modified to C-PTSD. Although because of the DSM, blah blah blah, for insurance purposes it says something else. I don't know why that matters but it feels invalidating. They don't recognize my truth and they control my ability to get treatment.

I did this thing called an Adverse Childhood Events or something. I scored a 10/10. I remember the first time I took it I told myself I was exaggerating or lying, trying to blame my parents at 47 years old. I reread the questions over and over and the memories just kept coming. It fractured my mind causing me to disassociate. It was very frightening.

What I can tell you for sure is that for the first 18 years of my life everyday, I lived in fear and the things that were done to me over and over again, are unspeakable. Every imaginable offence. Most was done by others while my parents were neglecting me although they had their share of abuses too, neglect, abandonment, physical, phycological. My parents weren't evil their lives as children were hell too. My parents paid for my silence. Not intentionally, but through guilt we stayed in a negative contract for 45 years. I mismanage my life. They give me money. I am the problem.

I couldn't break free of the cycle because I couldn't examine what had happened because I couldn't hold them accountable. That money has held me in guilt and shame my whole life. The money kept the abuse going. And now I don't know how to live without it. Even as I am capable of running a multi-million dollar company. I have traveled the world doing business and I don't know how to live outside of this dynamic because it's all I have ever known. No matter how much I've made it was never enough. I punished myself by selling everything I love to a pawn shop. My computers, my guitars, everything. That's how much I hated myself. I left myself with nothing. Because I was nothing.

I have lost what it means to be me. I am fighting with every fiber of my being to figure it out. I understand mechanistically why all this happen. the Bayesian perspective if you will. How I couldn't have done anything else because I did what I knew. I understand how my amygdala is high jacking my responses because of the reduction in pre-frontal cortex. How I have neuronal groups that should have long ago processed into deeper parts of my memory but the taste, the smells, they are all there.

Knowing hasn't helped the pain, the chaos, the overstimulation. Nor did the drugs. I can't take most because I get serotonin sickness. So my only hope is EMDR. I've read all the books, examined the case studies and believe in it. But the process is hard and the progress is slow. It's like lying on a table with a shattered femur and they put the bone back together one fragment at a time, while you are awake.

I keep fighting and I'm tired of fighting. I hope you can relate."
1hohd98,"I've been struggling a lot the past few days. I'm dissociating enough that my partner has noticed. I don't know how to articulate what's happening. But my therapist and I had a difficult conversation about avoidance and talked about addressing my early childhood trauma more directly. And since then I've been coming unglued.

When I want to crawl out of my skin like this it's so hard not to self-destruct.

Being direct is scary.

I don't feel able to verbally talk about the trauma. I feel so ashamed and disgusted by it that I get nauseous and dizzy. Lose my voice. I'm afraid to make it more real. And I don't want anyone to know what I did.

I'm scared to try EMDR again. Because last time I did EMDR I recalled a whole other trauma that I forgot about. It was jarring.

I don't want to open the can of worms.

I've written about this specific trauma a lot, but at this point I need to do more to process it. I'm just afraid that if I try something new I'll get flooded. Will push everyone away. Or will end up in the psych hospital again.

Every once in a while I see people say that trauma is ""like a broken leg that healed incorrectly and needs to be rebroken to be healed properly"".  Or they compare it to an infected wound that needs to drain. And I'm starting to wonder if I would rather just be infected, walking around on the incorrectly broken leg. Because I'm used to it. And this hurts so much.

I feel like I can't trust anyone or anything.
It makes me angry that this has to be so hard."
1gt9eua,"Does anyone suffer from an overly busy head? I developed it as a defence mechanism against bullying, I didn’t want to think about it, but unfortunately it made me think more about it.

I am getting better, but now my brain feels like an endless sorting machine, sorting through flashbacks and instances which were not nice to me. It’s a device I don’t need anymore, but is still here. 

For example, when I work I feel mostly fine, I have some thoughts, but it easier to be myself in work situations. When I’m at home, I just think and think endlessly. Ruminate, when I feel like I’m ready to move on. The only thing that makes my head peaceful is alcohol, which isn’t the best thing to use. 

I feel like my brain is trying to protect me in a safe world. It was unsafe once, but now I’m ok. I just don’t know why I have to overthink things anymore. Maybe it’ll take time to unwind and process what happened me, but it would be nice to have some space. I get space when I meditate, but after that it’s like ten millions different thoughts. It’s not easy. It’s an absolute pain having a brain that is too alert to everything. 

Also, I journal endlessly and it is sorting my thoughts out. Getting them out, feeling heard instead of trapped. But, it’s awful that I can’t combat this thing and live freely. "
1he198b,"I've been struggling after my first two EMDR sessions with a swelling of rage episodes, an increase in general bitterness/agitation, and thoughts (obviously no intentions) of revenge.

At first, I figured this was good progress for me; I've felt little to no anger over *anything* for the last two decades and change. Surely, a little bit of anger is a justified and healthy response to this, right? Well, perhaps it was at first, but now it just kinda feels like a problem.

I'm having a hard time in my relationships because I see traits of my abusers in them and lose the ability to connect, feel safe with them, and sometimes even feel empathy or worse for them because of the ways in which they resemble bad actors from my past. I have a hard time focusing because my mind always drifts to the injustice and swells and urge to do something about it, but, there's nothing to do about it because it's all in the past. And, I'm having a hard time leaving the house because anytime I look at anybody or hear anybody or try to have a conversation I am just overwhelmed with disappointment and upset at them, as if the entire world has taken on the burden that should only lie with a select few people from my past who actually did me wrong.

Has anyone struggled with this? And does anybody have any advice on getting over this? I do not want to be bitter or angry all the time or any of the things I am currently becoming, but my therapist is no help and I can't exactly go to the people close to me in my life and say ""hey I'm experiencing violent rage because everything reminds me of my abusers, can you please pretend like that's a normal and talk to me like a friend still?""

Any advice or shared experience is appreciated."
1hrlqqt,"Like the title says, it’s been just over a year since I stopped on my way to work to help someone who I thought slipped and fell. 
I was not prepared for what happened next. My adult daughter was with me and she called 911 and began chest compressions, I was not a narcan carrier at the time! FUCK THAT COULD HAVE SAVED HIM!
Anyway fast forward 10 minutes, I’m working on this guy try everything to will him back to life. EMT/paramedics showed up, checked him, then grabbed his shoulders and ankles and put him in the ambulance and drove away. 
Today while driving I saw a large duffle bag on the sidewalk in a pretty sketchy strip of our city, one hand on the door and the other ready to take off the seatbelt. 
Realized it wasn’t a person and BOOM, full blown panic! 
It’s 5 hours later and I’m spiralling. 
The only person who gets it is my kid and I’m not about to retraumatize her. 
My doctor has me on medication, but I don’t want to rely on it. I want to get over this feeling. 
I didn’t kill this guy, I didn’t give him meth, I didn’t deserve this mental anguish. It has literally changed me and it’s terrifying to think that this man, his choices and me stopping has changed my whole life and personality as well as putting my kid in that position. 
I hate him and I hate myself. 
I have talked to therapists, trauma councillors and my doctor. I don’t know what else to do. 
Thanks for letting me vent. "
1fhookn,"My doctor didn't specify what sort of PTSD I have, so if you see this post elsewhere (r/CPTSD) that's why. I went in for a doctor's appointment on Friday as the first part of a long attempt at trying to get help for what I suspect (and we shall see the results once I get my paperwork back from my doctor) is OCD. While filling out the paperwork for my symptoms for what they screen me with I was shocked to discover I had a lot of PTSD symptoms. The doctor ran threw a couple different diagnostic tests for me, and confirmed a diagnosis. Before last week, it didn't even cross my mind that I might have PTSD. I don't know a lot about PTSD, and it's kind of shaken me to my core. I feel like my identity as a person has shifted a little, and I don't know what to do. 

What was the experience for others? What did you do when you got diagnosed? What do you wish you knew/learned at the beginning of your healing journey?"
1afwhdr,"Hi all - To keep it short, I had to save my young son (7) from a rogue wave set that tore him off the beach in Hawaii a couple years ago. It took \*every. single. bit\* of everything I had to do it. At one point I made my peace and was on my way to accepting that I wasn't gonna make it, but I would be damned if he wasn't.   


We both made it out. I don't really know how, but we did, and neither of us needed medical treatment, but I wasn't ok. Immediately I knew I wasn't ok.   


I have been on meds (the nightmares, oh my god the nightmares), I have done EMDR, and both have helped, but it always feels like it wears off.   


I don't want to leave my house. Hell, I don't want to leave my room. I am constantly just waiting for the next bad thing.   


I feel like my friends and family, who have been very supportive, esp my loving wife, are growing tired of me. But I can't explain it, I don't want to do anything. I seem to be slipping into lower and lower power states, where normal things seem too hard to deal with, and I put off things until they are either about to go wrong, or right after. I can't seem to do anything that would ""save"" me from additional issues, money, time, whatever - and the worst part is I KNOW I need to do them and its like I handcuffed.   


Then on top of it all, I feel like a fraud. Like a charlatan. There are so many persons that are fully entitled to their PTSD due to the horrific things that have happened to them. I feel so stupid for mine, like its stolen valor.   


WTF do you do? How do you motivate? How do you go through this world and not see it like this anymore? "
1h2ugu4,"In an EMDR session a couple weeks ago, I processed a memory of my mom hitting me for the first time. Absolutely broke into pieces during it, I was sobbing and shaking uncontrollably. My whole adult life I had a hard time believing that I was actually abused, despite remembering the abuse. It just seemed like it wasn’t that bad, and I must’ve been sensitive and that’s why I got so messed up from it. 

This EMDR session changed everything. I realized my mom must have some sort of untreated mental illness. She pushed me insanely hard academically and had this weird irrational fear of me sleeping too much, so at the worst times she would only let me sleep 3-4 hours per night for months on end and would wake me up by hitting me, dragging me out of bed by my ankles so my head hit the floor, etc. I realized no sane person would do that, and realized all the moments in my past where she clearly didn’t feel “mothers love” for me like she should have. I realized I don’t know what a mother’s love feels like. To this day, I function as her therapist while she tells me I look like a whore, asks me if I ever comb my hair, etc (I look and dress like a normal person!) This was really hard to process, as I suddenly realized most people get their self-esteem and emotional regulation and notion of love from their moms and I missed that entirely. 

But my one solace was always that I had a good dad. Until a convo with my bf today. He’s always pushing me to tell my dad about the abuse from my mom - he worked a lot when I was a kid and has no clue it happened. I’ve never wanted to tell him. I finally snapped at my bf today and said “oh yea, you want me to tell him? Right now I get to see my dad once or twice a year. He never calls or answers my texts. He drives to a work conference IN MY TOWN once a year and has never stopped to visit me while he’s in town. If I tell him what mom did to me I’ll lose the one family member I have.” And. Yep. That’s when I realized I don’t know what a dad’s love feels like either. He just never hit me. 

I’m just… devastated. It suddenly makes sense. That time in my post-grad program when my professors invited my friends to my art opening  and said “we brought your family!” It weirded me out at the time, but it’s because I was the only grad in the program whose family never came to my events. They tried to fill a void for me. Or my mom’s friend who is always sending me the sweetest, sappiest messages (“I saw on insta that you sent your first 5.12! I’m so proud of you sweetie, you amaze me!!”). I always ignored her messages cuz I didn’t know how to respond. They seemed over the top and weirdly emotional. But I think that was love??? 

I can’t stop thinking about how different my life would’ve been if I’d known love. I wouldn’t have lived thru a string of abusive, traumatic relationships. I wouldn’t be a 30 yr old who can’t hold a full time job despite graduating top of my class with a degree in mathematics. I have all these tools but I don’t know how to use any of them, or even how to be human, or keep myself fed and hydrated. And I wish more than anything that I knew what a parent’s love feels like. It breaks my heart that I’ll never get to experience that. I think maybe one of the hardest parts is that I have a brother, and he didn’t get treated like me at all. My mom never hit him, or didn’t let him sleep, or told him that she wanted to kill herself when he was 6. My dad used to fly to the east coast every year to visit him, although he stopped doing that a few years ago. Why did my dad never visit me, even when he was in my town?? I’m super conflict avoidant and a people pleaser. I’ve become self-aware enough to know I’m not unpleasant to be around. I don’t know why he doesn’t want to visit me. 

I’m heading to my parent’s tomorrow for a Dr’s appt. I have a lump poking out between my ribs and my pupils have decided they no longer need to be the same size. With all the health problems I’ve been having, and this new realization, I’m so afraid I’m gonna fall apart while I’m visiting them. But I can’t cancel the appt. Because I need to get these issues looked at, and the wait time for an appt in my town was months. Sorry for the insanely long post. I’m just distressed, stuck in my feels, and wishing I could hire a mom/dad for a few days so I could know what it feels like. Here’s a lollipop if you made it to the end:🍭 (thank uuu 🩵)"
1his5ds,"I was having a rough go and decided to seek some therapy over the summer. Sessions were all going great and my therapist was gathering trauma history for EMDR. Well, this seemed to be taking forever. And at our last session in October, she left me completely retraumatized. The wounds we opened up were awful and I have been struggling since then. I can't function. I have been taking lorazepam every day since (and I do not want to be on benzos!). What can I do to help this?!?! How do I get unstuck now? I'm terrified to go back to her. "
1hjyn9l,"Hi! I recently got diagnosed with PTSD. I do not talk about it, except with my psychiatrist and my therapist, so I need a little bit of help/advice there. 
(only few trustworthy members of family, and friend that definitely never experienced a amount of traumas that could make them empathize/understand what kind of state of mind I'm in) 
Before starting, English is not my mother tongue, so I could make some grammatical mistakes, and I apologize for that. 
Long story short, I've got diagnosed 2 months ago with a PTSD that my psychiatrist think is there since 2 years. 
There's few symptoms that I find weird, and I wanted to know if I'm not the only one who experience those. 

Sometimes I got random ""outburst"" of fatigue and/or anxiety, but like, big ones. If I can fonction, what a cost, most of the time I need to wait for them to go away and rest. Sometimes it goes on for hours. 
I just feel like my body is numb when it's fatigue, and my mind is numb when it's anxiety.
I do work, which exhausts me twice as much as my coworkers, even when I'm not in an ""outburst"" episode. 

Also, I fortunately didn't experience SA or anything like that, but in most of intimacy moments I just cry ? I'm not sad or anything, there's juste tears coming up for few minutes, and need to stop anything. After that, I can ""restart"", but damn it's weird as fuck, especially because I didn't experience r*pe, SA and my partner is a good guy, and everything seems fine. It does not happen every time. 

And last but not least, combat reflex. Anytime someone gets near me, touchs me, or grabs me and I didn't see them coming, I protect myself or I clench my fists and throw a punch. It happens before I can even think about it, in few fractions of seconds. It's quite a fight of flight reflex. Luckily, every time I just stop before hitting someone, when I realized that person is not a threat, but I almost injuried some friends or strangers. I feel fucking guilty about that one, I don't what to do... My PTSD is not about a physical assault or anything like that so I don't know why I have such reflex... 



I'm currently doing everything to stabilize those symptoms and treat my PTSD, if you have some pieces of advice, especially for the last one, it would help me. 
I'm doing everything to have a normal life and to fonction in society. 

Thanks for reading that, I hope you'll have a great day 🫂"
1ds70ou,"I woke up this morning triggered. I'm still laying in bed, and I don't know how to process this. I'm not sure what to do right now. 

I used to work as a substitute teacher before covid. One day I was to work in a high school that I'd gone to as a kid. I had a social studies class. The routine with a substitute teacher is to come in in the morning, sit down at the desk, there's a paper in front of you that has your instructions for your classes for the day. 
 
I remember where in the room the desk is, and a lot of the details of the desk because that desk follows me around now.

I picked up the paper, and read it, while I had students coming in. The plan for class was to split the class into two groups, then have them, in character, debate the pros and cons of sending Jewish people concentration camps prior to World war II. 

I'm a genocide survivor myself. My family went through the Boarding Schools and I have C-PTSD from being used as a debrief person as a Pre-K child. I suspect that at least one of my ancestors converted from Judaism, based on some of the quirks from my grandmother. 

I decided I wasn't going to do that lesson plan. I did study hall instead. I was busy for the earlier part of the day, and I didn't have time to leave the classroom until late that day. When I did, I went to the principal with the lesson plan to object. 

The principle thought the lesson plan was completely reasonable, and wrote me up for refusing to follow directions. 

I walked out, and didn't go back to work again. I still haven't gone back to work. I'm functionally disabled, and I can't do job applications. I live because of Charity from my mother. 

I'm just sitting in bed right now, unwilling to get up because I don't want to face that damn desk. I don't know what to do. I'm just crying right now. I've done therapy, I've done dbt, we tried to do EMDR, but it was just too brutal. My counselor fired me. I'm usually okay, just today I just can't and I don't know why."
1hf70oe,"hi everyone, this is my first time posting on here. two years ago when i was 20, i was hit by a car while crossing the road. my PTSD symptoms didn’t begin until about six months afterwards. before the accident, i was about to start finally learning to drive and was excited about it. now, i still haven’t, and the thought of it terrifies me. i am doing EMDR therapy, and i haven’t began discussing driving with my therapist yet because it’s not my top priority in recovery right now. but i’m curious if anyone has had a similar experience, and if you did face your fear of driving how you found it? 
honestly, it’s frustrating for me because my trauma occurred while i was walking home from the bus stop, and now this fear means i have to continue to take public transport everywhere, which ironically is probably more distressing than if i did start driving. but i feel like i don’t trust myself to be a driver now that i’ve seen firsthand how quickly an accident can happen. 
thank you in advance ❤️"
1h22lrn,"i went through a near-death medical accident in 2004 at age 5 & i haven't recovered. it made me develop a good handful of medical-related PTSD triggers but the biggest one is vomiting. i cannot vomit or even cope with nausea without regressing, freaking out, screaming, crying, etc. and then i am re-traumatized for months or years after. i've tried dozens of medications, psychiatrists, therapists.. i've done EMDR.. nothing seems to cut my severe trigger of vomiting. i am constantly on edge, worried about what i eat, losing weight, washing my hands until they are raw every time i hear about a stomach bug going around.

my biggest question in life is.. because of having to interact with and face my trigger.. how do i find peace in life? how do i cope with the fact i am on edge and vigilant 24/7? it's a consistent source of anxiety that i can't just remove from my life, and if i could, everything would be different.

i think the thing that bothers me about ptsd is that i never truly feel relaxed, i think getting high is one of the only things that fully makes me forget, but even that is temporary.. i can't meditate because i can never find comfort or peace, only when i am dreaming. now that i am an adult, and still live with this, how do i approach the rest of my life with more hope for my future?"
1h6af1f,"It all started over a decade ago with a nineteen year-old me.  I had joined the US Navy out of blind optimism and idealism, thinking I'd be helping people and doing good.  That abruptly ended in the Fall of 2013.

Without going into too much detail, we were sent to prevent civilian deaths as their own government used nerve agents against them.  Fill in the blanks at your own discretion, just be warned, it's graphic.

Unfortunately, once we got there, we were told to stand by and do nothing.  Not even to leave.  Just stay on-station and do nothing but watch.  Lucky for me, I got to see it live as it happened.  If you've never seen someone die from nerve agents, I cannot stress enough how much I DO NOT suggest you look for it.  It's a horrible way to go.  And I got to see men, women, and children . . . 

Anyway.

We were also under constant threat at the time.  Another country I won't name to avoid political entanglement also sent their warships to the area.  Not to stop the wanton murder.  No no.  They were sent to stop us from interfering.  They're the reason we were told to sit and watch.  Because if we helped those civilians, we'd be signing our own death certificate.  Not to mention that the bad guys allegedly had material support from this unnamed country in the form of shore-to-ship missile batteries that could allegedly hit us before our radar could detect anything.  I went to bed every night for a month or two not knowing if I'd wake up on this side of eternity or not.

We went back three years later and did the exact same thing all over again.

I got out after that second deployment.  I was angry, hurt, and confused.  But more than anything, I was paradoxically numb.  I left Virginia and went back home to Minnesota.

On that last deployment, every time we stopped in a port, I was looking for a ring to propose to my then girlfriend, and finally found one back in Virginia before leaving for home.  I had been looking forward to seeing her for months, but the closer we got, the farther away I felt.  I couldn't even hold her hand while watching a movie.  I never did propose to her, and I ended the relationship right before Valentines Day the following year.  I felt awful.  Still do.  I felt like I was leading her on, saying that I loved her, but couldn't be there for her emotionally.  I was a husk.  And I felt worse for breaking it off right before Valentines Day.

I went off to college, but had a hard time focusing and dropped out after a semester.  I drifted from job to job, constantly on the edge of homelessness.  I had some really dark times in 2018/19.  Almost successfully. . . quit . . . a few times.  After that, I realized I needed help and reached out to the VA.

Went through the verbal PTSD screening questionnaire, but I felt like I had to answer . . . ""correctly.""  Like if I told the truth, that they'd look at me like a malingerer, like I was faking it for attention.  I mean, I hadn't actually been in combat.  A combat zone, yes, but no one ever shot at me.  I wasn't blown up in a convoy.  I had a relatively comfortable deployment where the worst thing that might happen was the SHF shitting the bed and not having Facebook for a few hours.  Oh the horror!  I didn't feel like I had . . . *earned* PTSD.  Like PTSD was some kind of demented status symbol for the real heroes, the guys and gals who actually did something to have the spicy memories.

So I lied.  Told them everything was sunshine and rainbows.  And so they treated me for depression.  And it kinda worked, for a little while.  I was put on medication which boosted my mood.  I went back to college for my teaching degree.  Met a girl, fell in love, got married.  And everything *was* sunshine and lollypops.

And then we moved out here to California, and I got set up with a new VA hospital and had to go through the screening again.  Except this time, my wife was with me, and I *couldn't* lie anymore.  I couldn't lie about the rage that had been boiling under the surface for years.  The routinely sleepless nights.  The blue faces I see when I close my eyes.  Constantly looking over my shoulder, suspicious of everything and everyone.  And so I ""failed"" the screening.  At least as far as I was concerned.  Like I said before, *I* couldn't have PTSD!  I didn't ""deserve"" it.  I hadn't ""earned"" it.  I was a support role kid whose closest encounter with danger had been the *thought* of danger.

Then they talked with me about PTSD.  And a lot of things made sense.  When I first came home after getting out, it wasn't just my girlfriend I felt distant around.  I felt like a total stranger around my parents.  Like I was an imposter who had learned everything there was to know about this kid and his family but had never actually met any of them.  I was constantly afraid of being found out, like they'd learn that I wasn't really their son or brother.  The alertness.  The anger.  The insomnia.  The . . . thoughts.  And it started coming together.


I've been going to therapy since then, and while it really helps to talk to someone about it and work through it, I still really struggle with it.  I still struggle with . . . wanting to quit.  I've been open with my wife about this, and she's been super supportive.

I hate to say it, but none of it has been enough.  I still have a hard time sleeping.  I've yelled at students to the point that they cried because my rage lanced through my protective shell like molten steel through a balloon, which then turned back inward as I was horrified at myself for making a child cry because I wasn't able to control my own temper.  And in the middle of the night, while my loving wife snuggles next to me, I'm still plagued by thoughts of ending it all.


""I'm tired, boss. Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. I'm tired of never having me a buddy to be with to tell me where we's going to, coming from, or why. Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world...every day. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head...all the time. Can you understand?""


I just want to stop being angry all the time.

I want to be there for my wife and family, both emotionally and physically.

And I want to wake up in the morning feeling rested.


Is that so much to ask for?"
1hdfhki,"I live in Asheville, North Carolina, and went through Hurricane Helene. I consider myself luckier than most. I lost where I live, but I have a new place thanks to friends, and didn't lose a lot of my stuff. I went three weeks not knowing if some of my friends in Chimney Rock and Lake Lure were alive, but I didn't lose anyone in the end. We lost utilities just like everyone else. It was survival mode for a long while. I coped by compartmentalizing and distracting, spending every day out of the house, delivering supplies and helping people out. I met people who lost so much more than I did. The more I talk about it in therapy, the more my therapist tells me it sounds like I've developed PTSD over it. I think I'm still at the point where it's hard for me to accept I have PTSD over the storm when other people around me went through so much more.

I have PTSD from childhood trauma, a specific person, and have gotten to a pretty healthy place with it. I know how to manage PTSD around a person, around loud men, things I can avoid. But now my PTSD is around places, and the weather. I went to Target yesterday, and had to drive through Biltmore village to get there, and it's still a warzone. There are still buildings caved in and massive shipping containers stuck in the middle of parking lots. I had to drive past the river and realized I can actually see the other side of it, because all the trees that used to be there blocking the view are gone. I drive past buildings I've driven past every day for ten years and see the marks from where the water was and still can't believe it got that high. I drive down roads that used to be so familiar and are missing buildings. I can't drive the usual roads because there is no road anymore. It's just gone, along with the houses that lined it.

I used to love thunderstorms. Now I get nervous when it rains. I tense up when the wind starts up. I'm on constant alert until the sky is sunny again. I hate that something I used to love gives me so much anxiety. I hate driving through some of the places I love most in the world and seeing them so broken. I'm moving come summer. I hate that I have to leave the place I love because a storm left me with less than I can replace. I hate that I won't be able to be here in the long run to help Asheville recover. I hate that after dealing with PTSD for 20 years and finally getting to a place where it's not at the forefront of my life, it's back again.

I didn't get affected much yesterday driving around, but it seems to have come to a head today. People are releasing documentaries around Helene now, and they're all over my youtube recommended. I'm seeing thumbnails with places I used to recognize and can't scroll past fast enough. Today I just can't stop crying. I find myself wondering about the river's height, even though it's sunny and hasn't rained for days.

I'm moving to Minnesota, near family, and I'm obsessively checking google maps around rental listings to make sure they're not near water. I just can't live near water. It makes me too nervous. I also don't like that Minnesota is so flat. The only reason my place survived as well as it did was because I was on a hill. Where do I go if it rains that much again?

I know this will pass. I know through therapy and EMDR I'll learn to manage, like I did before. It doesn't make the beginning of it any easier."
1gqyrxs,"As the title says. When I was 11, my mom tried to kill me by strangulation. A year later, she died after I ignored her calls (we had a restraining order against her), she later killed herself that night. 
I'm so tired. It's agonizing to live like this and I seriously don't know how much longer I can take it. 
I'm a senior now, and everyday I think about her, her death, my role in it. 

It's so fucked up. Constantly I flip-flop between being glad she died, and being willing to do anything to have her back. Between blaming myself, and understanding. Between loving, and hating her. The cognitive dissonance has genuinely given me migraines that lasted for hours, and I lie awake at night hyperventilating, writhing in pain because of it.

I don't know how to fix myself. I go to therapy twice a week. I have done multiple types of therapies including EMDR, and Accelerated Resolution Therapy. Nothing is working. 
What makes it worse is I refuse to resort to any addictive substances as a form of escapism because my mom was an addict and I refuse to be anywhere near what she was. So, I just exist, and suffer, and rot in my own head. 

I could go on. My mom starved me, and left me in motels with pedophiles as she drank to death. I found her seizing on the ground from alcohol poisoning. My first suicide attempt was when I was 9 years old. I should hate her for all of this, and I do because what the fuck? But I also would do anything to tell her I'm sorry, and I love you, and I miss you because the last time I saw her sober was the summer where I got my first period, and when I tried to flush my used pad down the sink, she grabbed it with her hands, and told me she would only do this for me, and then I just can't hate her. God, I just can't hate her. But then I remember her eyes as she looked down at me while her hands wrapped around my throat, and I feel grief, betrayal all over again. Because I could exist,  pretend when she was neglecting me, but I can't now. Not when she looked at me with eyes that conveyed such horrendous intentions I can't even speak it out loud. Why? Why would she do that to me? I was sleeping in bed, and I woke up to her strangling me. I had just turned eleven, and you were my mom. And then I couldn't even ask her why because she killed herself, because of me. 

I don't know what to do, what to feel, what to think and it's going to kill me. I can't live like this."
1h32pos,"TW: Mentions of 🍇, suicide, SH, PTSD crisis.

So, giving a bit of context. I (19F) was sexually abused multiple times as a child and it messed up with my head, from being suicidal to having a conturbed relationship with sexuality and desire.

After years of therapy and hating the thought of even kissing a man, I fell in love for my boyfriend (22M). We have been dating for one month (but we were friends for some years before).

He is the sweetest, respects all my boundaries.
I can't see him without him being fully clothed. I can't touch him. I desire him so much. But I can't. I can't. 

Last weekend, I had such a terrible crisis. We were making out on his bedroom and I tried to touch him, but couldn't. Then, we quit doing it and he said something without thinking, like a joke about me wanting so much but not being able to.

 He's neurodivergent and would never say anything on purpose, but as soon as his words reached my ears I started to sob uncontrolably, kicking and punching around, tearing off my hair, and scratching myself until I bled. 

When I got a glipse of his face, he was sitting next to me on the bed horrified, apologizing and crying with me, trying to hold my hand or hug me so I would quit hurting myself. But as he held me, I got even more tense and began to scream, ""no, no, no, no"" unrelentlessy. 

He took off his sweatshirt and gently put it on top of me, who was in fetal position scratching myself, held my hand and told me to breathe with him, stating to me that I was safe now, It's alright now. We breathed in, out, in, out, until I finally calmed down a bit. Then, he stared at me with such a careful, endearing, reassuring glare that I felt such a deep gratitude. 

I asked him to take a shower, but as soon as he left the door of the bathroom it started over again, me punching my head on the floor, trembling.

He returned, hugging me and telling me I was safe, I am safe. I am safe.

I asked him to bathe with me (we sometimes do that, him being clothed as I can't see him naked). He told me it might be triggering right at that moment, so he just did... such a kind act. He stood by me, holding my hand as I washed my blood, sweat and tears. He held  my head and washed my hair as he told me how beautiful and strong I am.

And I told him how much I love him and how unfair it is. How unfair.

It's unfair for him. He is such a gentle, wonderful man. He deserves someone who can love him fully. He doesn't deserve to go through all this.

And I had a terrible dream with him. Because it is unfair. Because my brain has scars.

And I hate my mind, because last night, I had a nightmare  again about being 🍇ed, and there was his beautiful face. I feel so terrible, so sad. Why would my twisted mind betray me like that? I feel infuriated. It shouldn't be like this.
I feel so sad. I feel so sad.
I just hope I won't remember this dream when I'm with him again, tomorrow. I just hope I won't get triggered again, I can only hope now.

I hope someone can relate to this... Maybe give me some advice...? I don' t know. I just needed to vent.
Sorry for writing this long and typos, english isn't my first language.

1fnj0z6,"I'm 17 years old and have been diagnosed with PTSD from experiencing sexual abuse when i was in middle school. I am assigned female at birth, although i usually dislike going to public bathrooms in general. Yesterday i went to the movie theater and i went inside their bathroom because i assumed it was gender neutral. After i left, i saw a mens sign on the side of the wall, although i didn't notice it before going in. 

When i entered the bathroom, i soon heard a group of men not only go into the restroom, but also talking for an extended period of time. I didn't want to wash my hands and leave them because i wanted to avoid them. After they did leave, i was preparing myself to leave the bathroom as well, until another guy came in. 

He first went into the stall next to mine, but then for some reason left the stall and went into the urinal instead. At one point, i briefly looked through my stall door, and i saw him with his head turned to my stall for some reason, and we made eye contact. 

I was extremely uncomfortable. I stood inside the stall waiting for him to leave, and the entire time i felt terrified that he would just wait for me to leave the stall and attempt to assault me. I don't know why his head was peeking over towards my stall, I don't think there was any reason for him to do that. The eye contact made me very uncomfortable and I had difficulty sleeping last night because I kept imagining it and how I felt when i was in the stall. 

I really just hate public bathrooms in general. I'm a trans male and I haven't even gone on hormones yet although I still get called sir sometimes so I try to just avoid gendered bathrooms (or run in and out of them very quickly) for my safety I almost always go into the female bathroom and I probably will until I'm on testosterone. This moment just left me feeling very uncomfortable and unsafe and I lost some sleep over it. Was i overthinking in this situation? Was it reasonable for me to feel so uncomfortable? I see my emdr therapist today and I was considering mentioning it to her although i'm having difficulty talking about it and i'm not sure if it's actually worth her time. "
1gi7bqu,"I was diagnosed with PTSD when I saw a therapist last year and I'm wondering if anyone has a similar problem as I do. I decided to see a therapist, because I didn't know what was wrong with me.

I have this problem where I am ""possessed with hatred"" over someone who bullied me or tried to intimidate me. I engage in this odd ritual, (not sure what this is or if it has a medical name), where I bite my hand and imagine violently killing and torturing the person who bullied or intimidated me. I'm not sure how to get rid of this, I just want it to stop.

Hatred is always haunting me. I remember events from my past where I was bullied, intimidated, made fun of, or tricked into doing something without understanding that I was being ""played with"". Some of these memories are over a decade old. 

It always begins with me feeling a strong sense of anger for not standing up for myself when someone bullied or intimidated me. Now it's gotten so bad, if someone honks at me or does something slightly intimidating or tries to make fun of me, I do this ""rage ritual"" of biting my hand and imaging myself killing them in a very violent way. 

Again, I just want this to go away. Does anyone have this problem and if so, what are you doing to treat it? Thanks."
1el693o,"I just reported my SA incident to the police via online and am currently waiting for them to call me to the hearing.  
It’s 5 am and I can’t sleep. I can’t wait to receive the invitation. Writing the report forced me to write out what happened to me, but that’s not the bad part. I wanted to ask some of my friends if they could vouch for what happened between us (he admitted to it in front of everyone at a party), but it’s been 3 years and they barely even remember him. It’s strange to think that it’s been 3 years when to me it feels like it just happened yesterday. I’d gotten used to “yesterday” being a bad day and always lingering at the back of my mind, but the fact that my friends barely remember anything about that time really put it into perspective how abnormal it is to have to drag this traumatic memory with me everywhere I go. How many more years until I can move on to tomorrow?  
I suddenly feel the same as I did 3 years ago when I first started mourning it. I was told that reporting it will force me to relive it and I thought I was ready for it, but I wasn’t prepared it to hit me from this direction. Writing it down really isn’t that bad. Talking about it isn’t that bad. The bad part is the way how I’m unable to forget even a single detail years after it happened.   
Anyways can someone send me some virtual hugs pls? What do I do about my anxiousness towards the hearing? What do I do about the memories? How am I supposed to put them down? "
1h1ce7b,"For context, I am diagnozed with MDD. I remember having s\_l thoughts since I was 12. Thankfully, I have been on antidepressants for two years now and am in recovery.

So this summer, I started to work on bringing back my childhood memories because I could barely remember anything that happened before antidepressants. And while doing this, I remembered an SA episode from when I was 6. I told my psychiatrist and was referred to therapy. We were discussing a lot of more recent stuff with my therapist and now, after 3 month, are starting EMDR. The introductory EMDR session involved the therapist asking me to describe the traumatic epizode in detail, so I started thinking about it a lot. From my memory (this is something I was confident in ever since I remembered the episode in summer, and I believe I recall remembering this even before in the glimpses of remembering about the SA episode even before antidepressants), it was done to the 6 y.o. me by a friend of my older cousin while on a vacation my mom sent me to with my cousin and my aunt (aunt = cousin's mother = my mother's sister). 

I messaged my aunt today asking if we went to that vacation with any friends. She said no, ""maybe only someone we met there"". 

I am wondering now. What if this all isn't real? What if I am just fooling myself into believing I have trauma I don't really have? Why would my brain do this to me? And if I just came up with this trauma myself, why do I feel so much self-disgusts from ""remembering"" about it? "
1fn8ezi,"Does anyone have any experience with electroconvulsive (shock) therapy for treating PTSD? I’m struggling heavily with getting past an abusive ex and it’s been ongoing for the past 4 years. It’s torturing me and I feel alone and like I’m running out of options. 

I’ve briefly tried EMDR but didn’t have much luck. Granted, I didn’t try it long term. I’ve been in DBT and I’ve had talk therapy. But I went to the psych ward recently and found out that ECT was still around and actually it seems to be quite successful. It has a high success rate and I wonder if it and any other similar therapies would help me. 

What therapies and other skills have helped you manage your PTSD? It’s not just PTSD, there’s a very strong trauma bond at play too. But I feel like if I manage the PTSD, the trauma bond won’t be as strong. Thank you for any advice! "
kqxiyp4,"Do it. I experience breakthroughs in each session that I haven't been able to from 10 years of talk therapy. 

Even if it only helps a tiny bit... Literally every bit matters. With PTSD even the smallest amount of improvement is huge."
lrtkj5i,"Very well, and I experienced everything you mentioned, too. I was traumatized 35 years ago when i was 6. Double homicide. Ugly story. though i was being taken to doctors, psyches, and therapists almost right away. Keep in mind, docs didn't understand much about ptsd, but i learned all along the way with them! 


Yes, EMDR works by kickstarting your limbic system which usually goes catatonic when traumatized. The bad part is your limbic system starts processing everything you experienced since the event. Right away it's tasked with processing the experience itself. i believe EMDR works by stimulating the vagus nerve that runs right where your temple is. watch this vid for a little more info. 


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fSN2CeDkslg


The vagus nerve acts to sooth your brain and body at all times and i think is involved in helping you feel joy and happiness. does taking deep breaths feel good to you? Probably not. Do you know someone that says it does? most likely because they're not dissociated from trauma. One of the things that happens when we go in to fight, flight, or freeze mode is we dissociate. One thing dissociating does is numbs your entire limbic system and the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is a HUGE part of our individual homeostasis. Without it, we're wild emotional primordial beasts. "
1f7h68o,"Hi everyone 😊

Just wanted to share a story of success with you.


Background: I've got cPTSD from lengthy, sustained childhood trauma. A classic! I've been fighting to get EMDR on the NHS for around 10 years. Typically, I happened to be pregnant when I finally got to the top of the waiting list so I had to have a few meetings before they were happy for me to proceed - I had to make it very clear that my PTSD is in no way related to pregnancy or childbirth, and we had to go gentle to not put too much stress on my body or baby.


So I finally had EMDR. I had weekly sessions for 13 or 14 weeks which probably covered 0 - 10 years old, so I'm back on the waiting list to help process (hopefully) the next decade.

It was incredible. I really liked my therapist. Such an interesting experience where I was processing several different events simultaneously. For me, it was also very freeing to not need to really talk about anything. I probably did 70% EMDR with 30% talking in my sessions, but I have a friend who did more of a 50-50 split.

I found EMDR completely life changing. I absolutely still have PTSD, but I feel like I've processed certain events from early childhood.

For example, the smell of smoke or soot used to give me flashbacks and I'd fall into a real pit of emotions from the smell. I also used to struggle to leave the house without returning 3 times to make sure that the oven, plugs etc were off. Both of these things are now not giving me trouble. Sometimes I experience some anxiety when near a fireplace (for example) that I might have a flashback, but so far I've had absolutely none. Absolutely incredible, so completely life changing for me.

So yeah, just wanted to share my little experience of EMDR with you all 🙂 would love to hear other people's experiences of EMDR if youd like to share 💖"
1h5fmzc,"I don't know how to say it any other way.  I have CPTSD from growing up in an abusive and neglectful household but 2 years ago I experienced a traumatizing medical event that has resulted in PTSD.  

I'm in therapy and just started EMDR but this is my first time doing EMDR and my therapist has me starting off slowly addressing smaller traumas from my childhood first.  I completely agree with his approach but I realize what a slow process this will be to actually work through everything and get to the big T that consumes me everyday.  Currently I am not even able to talk about what happened with anyone, even my boyfriend of one year.

Even though I'm alive, I feel like my life was taken from me.  Sometimes I wonder why couldn't I have just died then?  And with the type of event that occurred there is very little stopping it from happening again.  I live every second of every day on alert waiting and expecting it to happen.  I frequently have nightmares and often wake up thinking that \_it is happening\_ and end up in a full on panic attack.  I get scared and think that if I let my guard down such as when I'm sleeping that it will slip up on me and try to kill me again.  I think that's why I wake up panicking most days.  

Even though I'm in therapy and I have hope that EMDR will eventually help me, it is difficult to live this way for the time being and I expect it will be many more months at least before we even begin to address this trauma.  I guess I am wondering, how do you guys live this way?  I used to be really ambitious and had a lot of goals for the future and was about to begin my PhD in a field I love when this happened.  Now I am completely broken.  I don't want to die but I know that my life is not worth going through that same suffering again.

Thank you for reading.  I really just needed to get this off my chest to people who might understand."
1hoei1s,"For most of my life, i never felt any shame or guilt in being sexual or having/wanting sex (my mom was pretty sex-positive and open about sex education) until something happened about 2yrs ago which had traumatized me and created feelings of guilt and shame in my sex life and everyday life. With EMDR, I was able to confront what had happened and accept it so I could still move through everyday life like normal.
But my sex life is still plagued by immense shame. I have been able to mostly ignore it and have sex and repress things, but i experience more shame and embarrassment and disgust with myself than enjoyment. I thought everything was fine, but sometimes, out of nowhere, I'll have an intense dream or be intimate, and it will just ruin my day.
I have a loving boyfriend whose been with me since before it had happened, and our sex life was fine up until this happened, and he has a pretty high libido. Sometimes, even when he holds me, i hate it because im afraid he'll want something more. 
I don't want to go back to therapy. I feel gross even thinking about sex, so I don't want to do it in someone's office. 

I'm not sure what to do, and I'm pretty aware of what the problem is. How can I solve this on my own? "
1i3h7sj,"I grew up in an extremely chaotic and abusive household that cultivated a standard of toxic masculinity that is near impossible to reach. I was discouraged from crying or showing any emotion. I’m 20 now, and the effects of my childhood have been devastating to my future. 

I always imagined that once I got out it would be smooth sailing from there, but the past haunts my every move. I’m severely depressed and nobody around me notices because of how well I’ve been taught to hide my emotions. Nobody knows what I’ve been through and therefore they are unable to understand the depth of my character. I feel so disconnected from my peers and fellow students. I surround myself with the ‘wrong crowd’ because being around them makes me feel better about myself. 

I experience nightmares and sleep paralysis almost every night. I drink heavily and smoke weed often. I’ve been in and out of AA. I honestly feel as though I’m going mad. I can’t focus on school and I am thinking about my traumatic past 99.99% of the time. It never leaves my mind and it is the basis of every single decision I make. I honestly don’t know what to do with myself but I feel more and more hopeless with each passing day. Does this sound like C-PTSD? How the fuck do I cope with this? Can I live with this in secret? "
1h46xjz,"TW: mentions of online sexual abuse or harassment, manipulation, possible psychological abuse, grooming, SA, cheating, lying

When I was 13/14, I met a guy online named S in 2013 or 2014. We were 4 years apart (only 17 at the time). This took place on an app called Kik messenger. My abuse lasted for 2 years which was on and off cheating, me going back to S all the time and declaring my “love” for him. I was the second option/girl who chose, the backup plan.

S and I started talking a one to one basis in this group chat. It was this fantasy roleplay belief which I won’t say the name of. At the time, I felt so safe with S even if it was online. We had an LDR and it was great until it wasn’t.

As stated above in my two paragraphs, my abuser would date other minors like me. He dated my ex best friend (A) at the time who was literally 12 or 13. He dated another girl who was 16 named M. and later on, he dated yet another girl who was 13/14 who I will H. There was probably more minors who S was “dating” but I don’t have any evidence.

To cut it short, S sexually abused or harassed all of us. He groomed me and harassed and abused me on a daily basis for 1-2 years. All I ever wanted was for him to “love” me, want me, and just be a good person. I never asked for the cheating, lying, sexual abuse/harassment everyday, the mental torture, etc.

I couldn’t let him go. He was a big part of my life and I so desperately wanted to be with him in person. I begged for him to love me. I recall I wrote notes, letters to him I’d show him over Skype and in  photos, I’d listen to sad songs on repeat everyday, bottled up my emotions and told myself to not cry. It was so bad that I ended up developing depression in middle school after I left/blocked him.

People don’t like to validate this kind of trauma that I experienced because it was all online, but it was pure hell. I’m sure it was for the other girls too. I’d wake up with long messages from him everyday. I remember we’d call over the phone and “got to know each other.” I was even willing to plan out a trip on my own without my mother or any family knowing where I was going. I was seriously planning to go out to his state across the country just so we could be together in person. Live a happy life.

After I left however, I went back when I was 17. S said when I turned 18, he’d throw a “surprise” for me for my birthday. We chatted on Skype or video call one last time. He groomed me all over again and abused me for only 3-4 days I think. Made my trauma so much worse. 

I’m writing this because… I went through a severe trauma episode last night. I haven’t thought of this guy in years, but it doesn’t mean that the trauma isn’t there. I was having flashbacks, unwanted memories, and I was afraid to sleep. I remember I suffered with my trauma for 4 years with zero support from my family. I only went to my guidance counselor in high school and we worked through it together. I saw him every few days or every week… 

I already have a PTSD diagnosis as well from a sexual assault I went through back in 2022. I’ve done EMDR therapy for it. I’ve never spoken about this online trauma to a single therapist besides my guidance counselor in HS out of fear I won’t be believed.

I’ve had family, a psychiatrist, so called mental health professionals from mental hospitals fucking tell me that my trauma isn’t real because it was online growing up. To this day, I am seeing a therapist that’s a male. We’ve only been working together for maybe 5-ish months now? Yet, he’s told me that my trauma was probably just me ‘experimenting’ my sexuality…

So yeah.. this is getting too long. What do you guys think? "
1h2waye,"
For the past two years, I have been struggling with a psychological disease that has been treated but it wasn't diagnosed properly.  I am currently under the care of a Psychiatrist and a therapist.  Nightmares haunt me nearly every night, sometimes four times a week, and flashbacks intrude almost daily, triggered by random phrases, gestures, or just the sight of a familiar location. I now live each day in a constant state of fight-or-flight. Every moment feels like a battle, as I am perpetually scanning my surroundings for potential threats. I often experience flashbacks and nightmares that leave me shaken, and the memories of these traumatic events frequently disrupt my thoughts and focus. Certain locations, such as  the bookstore on campus, are unbearable for me; just passing by these places reminds me of the incidents I want to forget. Every time I meet new people, I worry about how they’ll perceive me. Will they understand my struggles, or will they judge me? These thoughts keep me isolated, afraid to form new relationships and even the friendships I do have feel strained. The physical pain I endure daily is another reminder of my trauma. My back aches constantly from past assaults, and despite seeing a chiropractor and attending physical therapy, the pain lingers. It’s a continual reminder of the violence I endured, layering my emotional suffering with physical discomfort. After years of trauma, I am ready to seek specialized therapy. But as I take steps to work with a psychiatrist and consider trauma therapy, I’m weighed down by the feeling that my journey to healing is just beginning, and the road ahead feels daunting..The symptoms of the disease  that I experience daily include severe anxiety, obsessive and uncontrollable thoughts about the event, feelings of depression, and a sense of detachment from my surroundings. I often have flashbacks and nightmares related to the traumatic experience, which can leave me feeling disoriented and fearful throughout the day.  I find myself avoiding certain places that remind me of the event, such as my freshman-year dorm, an area near the campus bookstore, and the third and fourth-floor lounges. Being in these locations can provoke intense anxiety and trigger memories that I would rather forget. I constantly feel on edge, and when I encounter specific triggers or situations reminiscent of my trauma—such as the site of my car accident or the old lifeguarding location—I tend to shake and freeze up. Triggers:Specific words, movements, and environments remind you of past traumas, triggering anxiety and fear responses. I tend to have 4 nightmares a week. I am still struggling to find answers as to what this psychological disorder"
kqtebq6,"Life changing. I went from feeling misaligned between my mind and body for my entire life  to actually being able to feel my physical being.

My therapist described it as...""imagine your thoughts are a river running....trauma is like a trees being cut down and blocking that river...so your thoughts don't flow or flow everywhere etc. EMDR allows the trees to flow down the river....removing the backed up water and for future things to flow better"".

It is the best money I have spent outside of IFS (which was also amazing for emotions stored in the body)

I love both these modes as they are evidence based and so proven to work."
kqse99a,"It saved my life. I went from being unemployed and unable to leave my flat to working part time w a relatively active social life :) it’s taken me 3 years to get to this point and I wouldn’t say I’m completely healed, but I can live a somewhat normal life again and I truly believe I owe it to EMDR. 

It’s definitely not for everyone as you can tell from these comments and can be incredibly taxing emotionally and physically, but if you have the opportunity and the time to do it and rest I’d highly suggest it!"
1gyqe1z,"I just started EMDR for my PTSD. the sessions are twice weekly and have been going well- and then this weekend I went away for a solo trip. I go for solo trips often and I've definitely gotten myself in some tricky spots (also I'm a woman). I've always been okay and been able to think/get myself out of trouble.  This was a trip to Austria, and was well planned out etc. Out of almost no where, after a missed train and some minor anxiety, (even though i made it to my bnb, safe and sound)I woke up on my second day unable to move, barely able to breathe, completely inconsolable. I had multiple panic attacks, which I haven't had in years (I'm more of an anxiety attack girl) and was unable to calm down. I had to book myself plane tickets home the next day, completely depleting my budget, and now I'm sitting in the airport is the first time I've been able to calm myself down. I know it's not the EMDRs fault and that it's helping me, but I can't help but wonder if recently uncovering memories and stuff has somehow led to these panic attacks. I can't even describe how bad and debilitating they were. It was also my first time having serious heart palpitations and hot sweats/completely immobile in years and years. I don't even know what I'm posting for, but I just had to talk about it. I'm too embarrassed to tell my friends that my trip was a total failure, I've been looking forward to this for months. And yet I couldn't even leave my bnb room, much less the house. "
1foqrgb,"My husband had been sick for 8.5yrs with cancer and it had metastasized. The last 8 months he deteriorated pretty badly. One night my older son woke me up, saying his dad was throwing up downstairs. When I got there, my husband was vomiting up bright red blood and huge clots. I'm a nurse so I acted on instinct and called 911 first. I went into the bathroom, told my husband i was there. My husband said ok, fell back against me, my arm wrapped around his chest and i felt his heart slowing down and stop. The EMT came in, looked at us, my husband covered in blood, in my arms, said ""OH My God,"" and walked out. 

I have had a mental breakdown, had to be taken out of work. Now I don't know what to do, whether to go back to work or not. I keep seeing the guy coming to the bathroom door and saying ""OH My God,"" and having nightmares. 

I can't do this anymore. I'm exhausted. I have kids and I'm losing myself. All I see in my head is my husband dying over and over. I need it to stop."
1h72u2j,"hello all, i’m writing here to see if anyone else has the same experience as me. i went through a lot of yelling/verbal abuse when i was younger and i was wondering if being yelled at triggers anyone else? like i physically cannot handle being yelled at, it triggers my fight or flight response and i get very angry. how can i work on this? its a major trigger for me "
1f5a31a,"Although this is tagged venting I would also very much like advice but this also for me to go just let it all out

One week ago today I witnessed by neighbour get murdered and I’m rlly struggling to cope with it all

For context I’m a 24 y/o male and last week I went over to my neighbours house just have a cup of tea like we do every week just to chat abt stuff bc I’m rlly close with her and then someone knocked on the door and this person demanded money and she said no and it turned into an argument and he stabbed her slammed the door and ran away i immediately called an ambulance and the police and went to go with her to see if I could help but she died before the ambulance arrived

 I’m dealing with such overwhelming guilt and the police want to question me and I don’t know wether I can cope i think I might break down during the interview I’ve been having flashbacks and nightmares abt it all the time

Please any advice abt how to cope with this situation in any way would be heavily appreciated"
1i36ibd,"I’ve seen people who have been to war, raped, sexually, physically, and mentally abused by the adults in their life, the people that they love or hate. What I went through was bad and may be seen as somewhat traumatic to some, I guess, but my body reacts like it was a serious trauma. I have the flashbacks and the nightmares. I’ll have days where I’ll suddenly remember it only once or not at all, and days at a time where the memory’s will just come to me multiple times a day. I’ll start hyperventilating and get dizzy, and then I get afraid I’m going to pass out and wake up in the hospital, and then causes me to freak out even more and freeze up. And then I’m super agitated for no reason and then I feel bad later for being mean to people. I have doctor’s appointments more than your average Joe (schizophrenia). Luckily the therapy, EMDR, and psychiatry are all in completely different areas. Except my neurology appointment. It’s the same hospital. I need to go to get refills for my epilepsy medication twice a year. I think the people there assume I’m rude. The nurses and front desk are at first friendly and polite, and I’m usually an extroverted happy upbeat person but when I go there I completely shut down, I’m slower, my voice for some reason won’t change, it will be like this flat tone with no inflection. They usually very quickly change how they treat me. Im guessing I’m showing no emotion either. It’s not like I’m sad or anything, it’s just like the fear set off so many alarm bells that my brain just went capoot stopped working. What helps though is I have this really cute palm sized stuffed animal that I have on my desk. It’s a cute ghost, in an egg shape with a zipper, and when you unzip it there’s a little cute smiling baby bat inside XD. If something suddenly comes up I just talk with them. If the world starts to spin I talk with them about my day. When I go to doctor’s appointments I bring them with me. Sometimes if it’s a bad day but I want to leave the dorm, I bring them with me and we explore the city together :). I feel embarrassed bringing them to class (even if they stay in my backpack and nobody knows about them). Plus I feel bad because they’re stuck in class with me. Plus I feel like I have to go to the bathroom all the time an hour or two before bed because I get so scared about having a nightmare. And I have sharp back pain that developed from sleeping in the beds (they were hard plastic block. The “mattress” that I had had nothing in it so I was lying on the hard plastic block and they refused to give me another mattress. I got back pain so bad so couldn’t stand and my nerves got caught in my rib cage making it so I couldn’t move. The flashbacks also subconsciously cause me to make noise, faces, and jerk my head. "
1dii4u8,"Hello,

I have PTSD from the horrifying experiences I went through when I was around 8 to 16 years old. I relive those terrible events every day and can't stop seeing those images. I take clonazepam and drink beer to help cope, but the images are too strong. Is there any procedure that can remove these thoughts from my mind?

"
1b2l122,"So I'm starting EMDR for medical PTSD soon and I'm gaslighting myself so bad thinking this can't really be the case because nothing super horrifically traumatic happened to me physically, I wasn't in war or assaulted, I almost feel like I don't have a right to be reacting the way I do? I feel like part of my reasoning for thinking this is because of all the stereotypes about PTSD and all the gaslighting from other people who tell me it isn't that bad. 

I was diagnosed with a rare, incurable neuro illness and I've not been the same since the hospital visit. I went through invasive tests and was bedbound in the worst pain of my life for over a month, when they told me the procedure was no big deal. I was also lied to and told my condition had a cure. 

I don't trust the medical system anymore, this has all made me realize how flawed it is. But my illness isn't degenerative (though I have to be very careful about medication that can worsen it.) And life would be so much easier if I could just go to a hospital like I used to without breaking down. I feel like I'm just being a big baby about it. There are obviously some problems with my brain though so I'm trying to tell myself it makes sense for my situation and not to beat myself up over it. 

If you've actually read this far, thanks for listening. "
1dnxbng,"In 2018 I was in a traumatic car accident and was later diagnosed with complex ptsd in 2021. I have tried driving with some family here and there since then but have always suffered from panic attacks during. I went to therapy and did emdr and still struggled with driving. I've barely driven at all and never alone until today! Out of frustration and adrenaline I decided ""f it I'm just going to do it"" and drove all on my own. I only drove about 2 miles but it's 2 miles more than I've done in 6 years! I also did not have a panic attack!  It has been such a mental battle and I know that I won't be able to drive like this every day but the baby step meant a lot to me and I feel very proud of myself. I also don't usually share personal things online but I felt this was a moment in my life I need to share. 😊"
1e8k28t,"Every time I go see a new therapist it’s like they don’t seem to think the diagnosis/label is all that important. I’ve done the ptsd questionnaire with a professional and despite being told that I clearly qualify, there was no discussion about an official diagnosis.

The last therapist I saw terminated me halfway through a session (just a few weeks in) and just said he didn’t know how to help me. He didn’t give any opinions at all on what he thought about the questions. He didn’t tell me whether he thought it was ptsd or if it was something else. I felt like I was kind of just shooed out the door. I at least respect that he didn’t want to waste my time but it’s draining having to go through this process over and over again.

I wonder if the fact that the worst of my trauma was caused by being harmed in treatment (TTI programs) is a hesitation for them because they also work in mental health treatment?? Like maybe they don’t want to believe or admit that the system could allow such things to happen? Idk… What I went through was horrific and I just want to be taken seriously. I feel like I can’t tell anyone. Bottling it all up is driving me crazy. It’s like I’m walking around with this huge secret. I’m worried that people won’t believe me if I open up and I think an official diagnosis would help. I want to try seeing another therapist but I’m not sure how to proceed. I’ve seen so many therapists already

Edit: I’m noticing I keep getting downvoted???🤷‍♂️"
kqstf62,Only therapy that’s actually made a difference for me. Highly recommend. It’s hard work though.
kqsi3ux,"Emdr isn’t for everyone. For me, it was the only thing to help me truly heal from traumatic memories. I go back to it Monday I am nervous but I am excited."
kqsmr3l,"It worked for me, but it does not completely erase your trauma.. It helps you manage it and your response to it, but it will still be on your mind sometimes."
kqxa01x,"It helped me to some extent.. yes go for EMDR ASAP

Maybe it will help you to overcome most of it not just a bit of your flasbacks"
kqr9udh,"I’ve had EMDR therapy for a couple years, and it was a wonderful, albeit intense experience. There’s a couple different methods: light bar, hand tappers, and the therapist moving their hand back and forth. The only one that worked for me was the light bar method. 
The first session, I thought it was stupid, and felt like it wasn’t working at all. I think it was after the 4th round of saying “nope, I don’t think or feel anything” (bless my patient therapist) that I completely dissolved into tears, and started talking and accessing emotions and thoughts I had previously locked away, and forgotten. Over the next couple years I was able to form several internal resources I still use, and process a LOT of my past. 
The whole point of EMDR is to bypass the part of your brain that want to be logical and suppress unpleasant memories and emotions, so you can access the trauma or issues. Once accessed, you can process them in a safe environment, and the memories lose their intensity. Now when I think about things that have happened, a large amount of them are just memories. I’m still working through a few, still have my nightmares, but I’ve been getting so much better. 
I don’t think it’s for everyone, but I highly encourage trying it, and being patient. The resource building at the beginning is SO IMPORTANT, so you’ll be able to handle the intensity of what happens in the following sessions. 
I wish you the best on your road to growth and recovery, and if you have any more questions, or want more details, let me know :)"
lepcmcj,"I’ve been doing EMDR weekly for about a year. The days after are really tough for me. Makes me feel like a child again all vulnerable. 

I wouldn’t say it’s the toughest thing I’ve ever done but it pays to be really honest with yourself about what’s bugging you so you can get the right target sequence plan."
lepz4p0,"It was life changing for me. Yes, I felt uncomfortable for a few days after each session, but my therapist used a technique that ""locked away"" what we were working on to bring back out during our next session and helped me visualize a protector or hero that had my back until then. I never had any issue driving home."
leopprg,"It was amazing! It was intense for sure and I took my time going to and coming back from appointments but I was able to take transit to mine. I also went to a cafe and had a treat after and gave myself the rest of the day to not need to be in very social environments. basically was kind to myself and gave my brain some quiet time. 

I am always happy to chat about it but it was something that worked wonders for me. It feels like it shouldn't work while it is working its crazy! Feel free to message me if you want to chat about it."
kumiz2b,"I seem to be the odd one out here, but I personally didn't get much out of it. That could be because of the therapist, or it could be because I can't really visualize things, or because I tend to dissociate, or the combo of PTSD + CPTSD, or maybe it just wasn't a good fit for me. It was better than nothing but only marginally. CPT has been more helpful for me, personally.

It wasn't too bad, though. Any sort of trauma therapy is going to bring stuff up and leave you feeling a bit drained and out of it afterwards, but EMDR makes it a point to end each session by bringing you back to a sense of safety."
kul8173,"I personally found emdr retraumatising and extremely dangerous. I think the therapist I had wasn’t aware of how damaging it was for me. I almost had a car accident on the motorway on the way home after processing one day (I would have delayed reactions to it that were very intense). Another time I blacked out the evening of processing and “came round” in my kitchen about to injure myself. 

For a long time I was afraid of going back into any therapy at all and my ptsd symptoms continued for a further 9 years. However I would now give it another go, but only with a very thorough screening of the therapist I chose. 

The reasons why I think it was dangerous for me:

• my therapist didn’t pick up on the fact I can’t visualise things. This meant the stabilisation exercises were useless for me. 

•He also didn’t believe how intense my reactions were afterwards. 


• I don’t think he realised how much I dissociated either. 

• There wasn’t enough time dedicated to building trust early on either."
kun04n7,"EMDR is life changing. I made more progress with my healing in 2 sessions that I have in months of therapy. I moved so I can’t work with that therapist right now but I’m hoping that I can get back into it with my new one. 

I have a few traumatic life events unfortunately, but one of them is surrounding my child’s birth. I couldn’t talk about it without crying and being sent into an anxiety attack. I’m to a point where I can now freely talk about it with people and share my experience. We’re all different in how we process and heal but EMDR has done wonders for me. I still have a loooot of work to do though. 

It’s scary and so hard to feel those emotions that come with our trauma, but it is truly rewiring your brain to get you closer to a better functioning person. I believe in you and hope you can find the healing you need"
kunnns4,I’ve been wanting to try it for almost a year after trying different methods of therapy for almost 40 years. I had psyched myself up for my first ‘taster’ session but unfortunately my therapist said I was stable enough because of my BPD and dissociation. I also have CPTSD so I thought this would really be the end of therapy for me. I’m disappointed.
kukrsyy,"I had EMDR and its life changing - you're not reliving the PTSD cause, it effectively alters the way your mind perseves the event/s. I'd recommend it to anyone. 4 sessions later for me I was sleeping ok, and wasn't having anymore physical sensations of the event. There's some great videos on you tube of people who were worried about it, and didn't regret it. Wishing you well 🙏"
kunjt4m,"I’m still doing it, but I noticed progress after the 2nd or 3rd session. Even after the first session, I could tell it was going to be fore effective for me than the other types of therapy that I’ve tried. 

Everyone is different, but if a therapist that you’ve been seeing for over a year suggests it, there’s probably a reason for that. It helps more with the emotions than the logical parts of the events or aftermath, while something like CPT is based more on logic and reason. 

For me, EMDR is effective because I could already see that it wasn’t my fault, and these things were unusual experiences that probably won’t happen again…. But I couldn’t stop the feelings I had about it, or the fear of it happening again."
kulq8o9,"I think where you’re at in your life right now is a really important consideration. I needed everything else around me to be incredibly stable when I first tried it and even then, as others have said, it was incredibly tough. I ended up pulling out early on because I had a job change and knew I couldn’t manage both. It’s a very personal thing and whilst it’s clearly incredibly beneficial to many people, you know yourself and your tolerance best. My regular therapist has subsequently trained in EMDR but given my history of dissociation and self harm, it’s not felt like the right thing for me for now, though again, many people also experience those things and have success with it as a treatment. Can you talk through your concerns with your therapist? My therapist has made it very clear that I need to feel in control of the process and can stop at any time because so much of my trauma is as a result of things that were out of my control. It sounds obvious but I needed that permission to say, no, this is too much for me right now. Sending you strength whatever you choose."
lwqsyc2,"Hi - I actually have a had a few amazing mentors tell me to check out EMDR bc it helped them with their PTSD. I haven't pursued it for financial reasons, but I have heard a relatively large number of endorsements  for treatment of PTSD. It couldn't hurt to try, but keep in mind that mental health treatments are not one size fits all - we are all unique people."
1c3ie1e,"So I've been in EMDR for over 6 weeks and I've heard great things about the process in general but I feel like I'm getting nowhere with my current therapist. I've attended at least once a week, sometimes 2 and I feel like I've done nothing. 

The whole time I've been in there, I've only processed one short memory. I've only ever touched the buzzers (we opted not do to eye movement for medical reasons) twice and that was like 4 sessions ago, nothing since then. I feel like I'm really just going in there to socialize. I know you're supposed to build a relationship with the therapist and not just jump straight into it, but I told them right off the bat that I'm really struggling, my life is at a standstill, and I'm getting into dangerous territory and I need help asap and had to push quite a bit to be there twice a week and then my appointments started getting cancelled and put back down to once a week.

I feel like I'm really just going in there and venting about how I need help and still not really receiving help. I've been asked questions that have made me uncomfortable, such as my high school dating history and sexuality (which has nothing at all to do with the trauma I'm there for), and I ended up flat out telling him I'm uncomfortable and I don't want to talk about that stuff, which he stopped but now I'm super wary and I don't know if it's just because I'm not mentally well and may be misinterpreting. 

Does EMDR take this long to start? Is it normal to be asked very personal questions that have nothing to do with your area of trauma? I want to advocate for myself and get the help I need but I don't know if I'm over reacting or if I should just save my time and transfer to another facility. Can anyone else share their experience? "
1hkuczo,"I have ptsd from sexual violence almost a decade ago. My brain cannot stop trying to look up old conversations, evaluate old videos, find old emails between myself and the individual that harmed me. Every time I feel drawn to do this, I end up feeling exhausted and depressed. I hate doing it, but if I don’t it feels like an itch I can’t scratch. It just bothers me over and over again. 

What if there was a look I missed in a photo? A message that I should’ve reread? Something I should’ve kept as evidence? I will “what if” myself into the goddamn ground and I cannot stop it. It’s so exhausting and terrible. I can’t focus on anything else. It just consumes me. 

I also can’t help but say his name unconsciously. The more stressed I am, the more I say it. Over and over really fast. No one notices, thank God. But as you can imagine, I fucking hate it. I’ve tried replacing it with other names, other terms, songs, and I’ve tried flicking my a rubber band on my wrist when I do it. Nothing seems to curb it. 

Why do I do these things? Is there a medical term for them? I’ve brought these issues up to therapists and no one seems to know why. I’ve tried EMDR therapy for several sessions but I don’t think it helped :/ has anyone who’s had these symptoms been successful at overcoming them? "
1d6ppk8,"I don’t know for sure if I have PTSD because I don’t experience flashbacks and can remember the events pretty clearly, but I know for a fact that I have a LOT of unprocessed trauma from the last few years alone (to keep it brief and not too graphic, I had to witness a best friend’s near death experience and then had one myself almost exactly a year later). To make things worse, I never processed it because I could never take a break from school for more than 2 weeks. This caused me to have a severe nervous breakdown a few months ago (which in some way, was also a traumatic event for me and I’m not sure why). 

Now that I’ve graduated school, I want to actually take time to work through my trauma because it’s robbed me of joy and my hobbies, as well as exacerbating my OCD to the point of it being almost unmanageable. I’ve been in talk therapy for years but never talked about my trauma in depth because I was scared of triggering myself. I have always wanted to try EMDR, but I’m really scared of it being too much for me to handle. 

I wanted to know: what therapy worked best for you guys to get over your trauma (or at least cope with it), whether that be talk therapy, DBT, EMDR, etc? How did it help and how did you feel afterwards? "
1ak9048,"Last December 2023 I had a perforated colon and went into septic shock. Long story short I almost died and while i was in the hospital for 10 days she came to support me and ended up getting covid with my then 1 year old daughter. I ended up surviving, but my wife mentally lost it. I think she may have went through a type of psychosis... The doctor since has her on medication (prozac) and she's been doing therapy with betterhelp for several months. She developed severe contamination ocd and agoraphobia. We've been working on exposures,  but recently it's killing me mentally... We went to the dentist recently and she lost it because the Dentist wasn't ""clean"" enough. I'm facing her looking at me crying hysterically saying"" I can't stop the thoughts"" in front of my children. She's looking at me pleading for me to help her...I'm at a loss... Is there anything else I should be doing? Any idea what she's going through? I believe it's ptsd comorbid with ocd.

1hd2fb6,"I've had a PTSD diagnosis since 2019, and was wondering if anyone else ever experiences this?

When I'm triggered or experienceing a flashback my eyes dart back and forth involuntarily from left to right over and over. Its usually accompanied with a lot of blinking. 

Its so common for me that romantic partners have told me they can tell when I'm having an episode because of the eye movements. 

I do not have nystagmus, eye problems, or history of a TBI. 

When I try to google this all that comes up is info on EMDR. Which is great, but not what I'm looking for! "
1i35r1u,"I don't have many people to share this with irl, so wanted to share my progress with someone.

I've been doing all sorts of trauma release activities since June last year. About 4 months of EMDR (then I ran out of subsidised sessions and will start again next week) and 4 months of TRE. Heaps of grounding and vagal nerve exercises. I was doing some talk therapy before this but it wasn't working for me.

Progress has been there, but it's often felt like some f-up cha cha where it's two steps forward and two steps back.

Well, I've held off posting to see if the progress would stick. But its lasted about 10 days now. I had a huge flair up of anxiety and insomnia beforehand - but it seems I've released a nice chuck of my trauma because things don't feel quite so heavy during my day-to-day and I'm getting to sleep easier without being tortured by all the memories and pain as I try to sleep.

I definitely still have some way to go. I still can't see people without triggering. My head is still offline a lot. I still have to work on getting to sleep earlier. And am not working.

But the burden feels lighter, so I guess that's something. And it's really nice not to be tortured by the memories quite so much.

With all the remaining problems, maybe it's not really much progress idk. And the 'success' flair seems like an oversell. But it's taken so long to get to this point ... that honestly thought it was all over and I would never get better. But maybe I'm on the right track ... that there is a bit of hope."
1gxqpo8,"Hi guys. This is embarrassing but I need some advice and I’m not sure where else to ask. For a few years now, I have not been able to sleep without having ‘protection’ over my genitals. This, unfortunately, is in the form of my hand bent into a very awkward position where my wrist area is at the top with the rest of my hand kind of cupping over the rest of my ‘bits’ (also over my butthole, feels very weird to explain but very important to details). I have hypermobile elbows and wrists and this has started to take a big toll on my arm joints. My shoulders are sore almost every morning and whatever arm I happen to use will have sore joints at least for a few hours the next day. It’s a shot in the dark but I was wondering if anyone else has a similar symptom and has found something that works that is not your arm? 
I’ve tried multiple pairs of underwear, multiple pairs of pants, pillows, stuff stuffed in between. Nothing gives me the ‘safe’ feeling that I need. I’m almost considering buying one of the ‘female portable urinals’ and figuring out some way to attach it to my body while I sleep but I feel like there’s no way I could make that comfortable enough to sleep in either. 
I think that the specialized area pressure is very important in the security of the feeling and why nothing else has worked for me so far. Would greatly appreciate some advice if anyone has any. Thank you and sorry for the awkward read"
1h2fs8h,"I’m after some advice, kind words, and encouragement for me and my partner. We’re in a tough place and despite immense love for each other have caused and so become the triggers for each others PTSD.

Summary: I got very ill with severe burnout a number of years ago, I suffered severe depression, Suicidal OCD and prolonged derealisation. My partner supported me throughout and was amazing, but it was so hard for her and resulted in her developing PTSD once I’d started to get better. She got some help a few years ago and made big improvements but she never managed to fully reengage with my emotions again, and so for the next 2 years whilst I was caring and supporting for her every single time I got upset or tried to voice feelings I was shut down, screamed at and told she didn’t want to hear them. This continued and became a systemic denial of my feelings, with the worst and most ironic being when I’d raise the issue of not being allowed feelings as this itself was shut down. 

I’ve likened it to abuse, but understand that it’s never been intentional but it has had an impact, just like my illness impacted my partner. She has such compassion and care over any issue that isn’t related to her, but as soon as she was/is told she’s hurting me in anyway she reacts with anger and blame. I have recently been given a PTSD diagnosis as a result of this unintentional emotional neglect.

This leaves us in a terrible position where I’m triggered and dysregulated by the fear of not being able to safely share my feelings and the fear I’ll be told off, and she is triggered and dysregulated by me talking about this and what’s happened between us, which in turn denies me a chance to discuss feelings making me worse which makes me want a resolution so I try and discuss it….etc etc round the shitty cycle we go!

My diagnosis has helped me at least identify this cycle and so understand why we’ve been having such huge arguments despite such apparent love and care. We have been breaking each other without knowing why, I should have helped her PTSD more, but she’d improved and told me it was fixed (it was gone for a while but I was naive in not realising it could return). I’m starting EMDR and am encouraging my partner to revisit her previous work when she can muster the energy, we’re seeing a couples counsellor as well. We have such love and good times are great times, but we’ve been exploding and arguing much more than is healthy, I’m hopeful that realising why will help but fearful the damage done is too great and we’re both too broken.

Thank you for reading and any kind words, tips on regulating emotion when triggered, encouragement etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading"
1gzx4to,"She wants to move away from school bullying memories even though I have so many of them and work on something else for now. :( I'm worried I won't make progress if we do something else. What do I do? Is this her way of believing the bullying isn't what's bothering me currently and I need to work on what's bothering me right now based on when I talked to her about ehlers danlos concerns this morning? (I just said I was concerned what my kids would struggle with if I even had kids and if I should have them based on the fact I worry they'll have a deadly heart problem) or be worse off than me...

1df1egt,"I've tried over five medications, none of which worked, only giving me side effects including nausea, insomnia, constipation, or even an allergic reaction.

I've tried one supplement, but honestly I'm not sure how much of an effect it really had on me and if others would work best.

At this point, the only other option I can see working for me is medical marijuana or EMDR therapy. I've been in therapy for almost a decade, and while it's significantly helped me and continues to do so, I still live in a toxic household that makes it feel impossible to heal from. I need something to make the symptoms more bearable. The depression, anxiety, and OCD is unbearable, and it's hindering my life and relationship with my partner.

For those of you who've tried medical marijuana for PTSD or OCD, how much has it helped, and are their any negative symptoms I should be aware of?

I'm not interested in getting a 'high' feeling, just something to keep my body relaxed. I don't want to feel drowsy or lack cognitive abilities, I just want to feel sober and not constantly in fight or flight mode. If medical marijuana isn't right for this, what are other options for me? I appreciate any advice, thank you."
1gkhjlp,"I DONT KNOW HOW TO EDIT FLAIRS BUT CW IS FOR CHILDHOOD SA AND SEXUAL TOPICS




I’ve been a depressed child even before the first traumatic event I remember, and I’ve also been uncomfortably hypersexual for as long as I can remember, despite being ace. Went as far as I remember having questionable daydreams back in kindergarten and feeling disgusted by them and hating myself for having those but couldn’t stop indulging myself in that. I’ve had many traumatic experiences but there are some triggers I can’t  explain despite seemingly remembering at least some details about each event and being able to tie triggers to where they came from. All of this lead me to realize today that there may in fact be an event that I don’t remember. I’m not going to emdr yet so this is really not productive for me at all and I’m just freaking out at the implications. I think I’m gonna cry. "
1gd0dxh,"Hello all. 

Recently, I was diagnosed with ptsd with dissociative features. After a pretty band panic attack that’s left me pretty badly disassociated since June of this year, I started therapy recently, and was given the ptsd diagnosis. It’s been pretty heavy, but the good news is I’ll be starting emdr therapy soon. I had a few questions for anyone else experiencing this as well. 

1) how long do/did your disassociation last?

2) while in intense disassociation, is it normal to have hallucinations? (Mostly for me it’s auditory, and it’s always random words. Occasionally I’ll see things, but I’m aware both are hallucinations. Even though I’m afraid I’m gonna lose that grip)

3) if you’ve done emdr, did it help? 

Thanx a bunch! "
leql9xk,yes. I don't know how it worked but I stopped having violent nightmares all the time.
1cnh093,"

I started emdr for single-event trauma but we later found that there is cptsd underneath. So what does emdr actually do to treat and will all my physical symptoms(big anxiety) disapear at the end? How do you measure progress and what does it look like when it worked?"
kqy7evj,It helps some
1goz87a,Anyone have any personal experiences or advice about EMDR? I’m scared it’s going to make me spiral but I hear it helps in the long run. 
1dzlw97,Are there people in this subreddit that use Weed to help soothe symptoms? If so does it help at all? I haven’t smoked since before my diagnosis and I’m curious if people can testify to if it helps them or not. It would be nice to hear people’s opinions on this 
1dowgue,You would be very surprised! Take it from my word! It helps a lot to exercise the brain with problem task solving and keeping it very active whether it be team work in war simulations in Call of Duty or Building homes or castles in Minecraft or small humble puzzle games like Tetris or online Chess to keep the brain destressed or distracted.....

kqv6dgv,EMDR saved my life. Absolutely helped me resolve so many of my symptoms. I have cPTSD.
kqufun3,"EMDR retraumatized me, going over the events and imagining a different outcome just didn't feel right, I had a freeze response which probably is part of the problem, but which may have saved my life. I had to imagine fighting or fleeing during the EMDR but it had no effect at all. Possibly because I realized it's a mind trick and set low expectations because of it. Freezing just keeps you stuck in fight or flight and ptsd easier I think since the energy wasn't channeled at the time, it just takes over your nervous system entirely. I can see how every panic attack is a protection mechanism but it sucks to be hyperaroused all the time and reliving one moment years on end because of 1 real emergency I couldn't handle."
kunqstk,"EMDR saved my life, I am a retired Anti Terrorist Police officer and was heavily involved in the policing of the terrorist incidents in London in the 80s. My PTSD came to a head in early 2000s and I wae referred to my local NHS mental Health unit to see a therapist. He decided to treat me with EMDR and the treatment took place over six months. I can only describe it as having a net curtain in my mind in which I could see the incidents of trauma that took place. With each treatment , that net curtain got thicker and thicker until I could not see that incident trauma clearly any more. EMDR and our wonderful NHS saved my life . Good luck, it needs courage to deal with one's demons, so suck it and go for it. If you ever want a chat DM me , good luck"

kqsj38h,"Helped immensely. You have to really commit. You have to almost fight against the dissociative response. It’s very difficult and taxing. It will not work for everyone, however I do think it’s worth trying."
kqtnbpm," Yes I’ve had a few sessions (I have ptsd from a lot of things) and it’s helped me, and also helped me learn a lot about myself. I’d 100% recommend it"
kqstuki,"It can and has been helpful for people but there are also concerns around it in the psychotherapy community regarding effectiveness, ethical concerns with the founder and cult of personality surrounding it, and sometimes the cost. The concern with effectiveness isn't so much that it doesn't help people, but that other forms of therapy are just as (if not more) effective. I've also heard it indicated that it can be really good for specific traumatic events (for example a death in the family) but less effective for trauma occurring over a long period of time such as cptsd. 
If you're interested in learning more there are some good videos and studies about the controversy but ultimately if you want to try it it is still worth a shot, but considering other forms of therapy may be worthwhile as well.
If you feel it isn't working for you you can discuss with your therapist and try something else, or ask for referrals out. A lot of therapists are trained in EMDR but also have other modalities and tools to utilize."
kqsikz7,"It really helped take the sting out of some childhood abuse traumas that I kept getting sucked back into trauma loops with and then the spiraling, depression collapse that follows. It's not a miracle cure and the memories don't really go away, they just hurt less. They get put in their correct timeline (in the past) and that helps a lot. Instead of the extremely vivid live action Extended Edition Director's Cut movie of the traumatic event, it's more like an old, faded picture."
kqujm2p,"The therapist I saw said it tends to work better if your traumatic experience is more recent, was a one time event, and you are willing to talk about it in detail. I fit all 3 criteria and had excellent success. My PTSD is probably 80% better than it was before. It can still help in other situations, but may take longer."

kummoe7,"EMDR changed me. My whole existence changed. My experiences with looking directly at the trauma, cutting out the b.s we put on those experiences to make them make sence, to stare at the demons then jump into the abyss only to realize it was only knee deep this whole time. It's been so healing, so empowering, so...idk it's been so incredibly helpful and I hope, I'm your time, you also try it and hug that hurt kid on the inside and let them know...you've got this and they can take some needed time off. Nothing to fear but what you've told yourself is to fear so...say it differently to yourself. Change the narrative. I can't do this...yet. See how that little word yet made the difference? Hope that maybe this year you'll give it a go. You're stronger than you realize and can handle it. You already survived it."
kupnp2r,It was incredibly helpful with my PTSD. I loved it. I recommend it to anyone that is able to have it
kul5bir,"I’ve found EMDR to be incredibly difficult and painful initially - processing can be really hard. mainly because it’s reprocessing difficult emotions. but after a while you get used to it, and it’s super helpful. best of luck on your journey OP!"
1hugqmc,"I'm telling you my experience hoping someone can help me understand what to do: after giving birth to my daughter I suffered from severe anxiety. Various psychiatrists prescribed me SSRI’s that didn't work. I would wake up in the morning with anxiety and go on like that all day. In the evening when I returned home from work it was the worst part: I had many intrusive thoughts that literally scared me to death. I felt huge waves of fear and I couldn't do anything. I couldn't cook or wash my daughter. It was horrible.  I had a lot of paranoia, a lot of anxiety, fear, I thought I was going crazy. The mere word ""crazy"" or ""psycho"" made me scared because I was afraid of becoming one. The worst time as I was saying was around 5pm until just before going to sleep when everything faded away and became livable. All this went on for 4 years until a doctor decided to have me do blood tests which revealed a hormonal imbalance. They prescribed me the pill (bc) and since then things have definitely gotten better. I no longer have anxiety and only when my period comes and during the first pills I feel anxious again. I forgot: at first they gave me a pill that was probably too strong and it sent me into a deep depression for a few days (until I stopped taking the pill and things gradually got better).

I'm finally better but I have several memories of these past four years that often make me worry and don't let me live my life well. In particular when I hear about depression I get very scared because I have really bad memories of the days that I had to go through. Furthermore I never live the afternoon well. Those hours from 5 to 7 pm always scare me a little and I'm not happy. 

There are days when I pay little attention to it and days when everything becomes dark and I cry a lot for what happened and for the fear that it could happen again.

This is my story, and I would like some advice on what to do. I’m really afraid i might get worse with emdr but i don't want to miss an opportunity to be really well. Or maybe cbt could be enough?

I am currently on 10 mg of paroxetine and the contraceptive pill.

Please be kind and reassuring. Here is a mother who has suffered so much and who would like to free herself from all this to be able to live better with her daughter and her family.

Also: I hope my story can be useful to some other mother too 🩷"

lwsj0oz,"I've honestly never heard of EMDR being disqualified because of a particular cause of somebody's PTSD.  I use it with my therapist (we are working on my C-PTSD), and we often use it in combination with parts work.  The general idea of EMDR is to give physical stimulation to avoid or reduce triggering/distress when thinking about traumatic memories or other difficult things.  So it can be used on its own to process traumatic memories or in combination with other methods to allow deeper access to things that usually cause a lot of distress.  I've personally found it helpful in this sense that I've been able to untangle a lot of ""stuff"" in my head that otherwise I wouldn't be able to get near.

Side note: psychiatrists deal in medications, not therapy, so if a psychiatrist is giving you advice on therapy, maybe just take it with a grain of salt."

My therapist said I’ll definitely need a self care day following since it can be intense. 

What’s your experience? Should I be nervous? Is it daunting, but the only way to heal is through the pain? 

Thank you in advance! "
1cpz0mf,"I have a lifetime of abuse of every kind, and neglect.  My targets for EMDR are numerous, and after 5 months of EMDR we are stuck on only my 3rd target when I was 10-11. I can't seem to get past this one, it's still very charged.

Simultaneously, I am getting triggered every week or so by my parents, whom I am now living with because I was laid off after being unable to cope with the PTSD symptoms at work and without accommodations.  In other words, I am stuck here with the two people who say they love me, but are my first abusers, and continue with the same behaviors.

My 8 year old lives with us as well. They aren't able to ""neglect"" him like they did me, b/c I'm his mom, and I protect him from their mental/emotional games by creating safe spaces in our rooms and with outside activities.

However, being triggered now is making it harder to get through my target, especially this one I'm stuck on. My therapist asked if we should suspend emdr, and I don't know what to think. What happens to all those targets? I've had so many flashbacks, so I'm remembering ""new"" trauma now and then, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with it if we stop EMDR.  How am I supposed to bottle up and forget all the stuff that's been ripped out of my brain from 10, 20, 30 years ago? 

I feel so hopeless about my life now. I can't even go to the grocery store, for fear of seeing one of my abusers or rapists, so trying to get a local job (small town) is even more terrifying! I was counting on EMDR to help me deal with it all enough to be able to work ""through"" my disabilities, so what am I supposed to do? My son is the only reason I'm still alive right now. I can't end it and leave him hurting because of it.

Does anyone have any experience with this and can give me guidance?"

19d28r0,Everything I've heard has been bad. Really bad. The only thing stopping me at this point is needing a white noise machine but a couple places I called say no.  I literally can't sleep without white noise. What do I do? Do these places really help.  I've been doing therapy and meds since she died in April. I'm not any better.
1c6oqzq,"in the long run, does therapy actually help? if yes, what type of therapy (EMDR, CBT, DBT, etc)? "
1gtzhm5,"My (35F) boyfriend (35m) is a veteran. He has always struggled with paranoia and insecurities. He has cited PTSD for this. But I think he’s having a mental break. 

Constantly thinks I'm cheating and people are against him. He blames his PTSD and ""not trusting people"". Over the last two - three weeks he has seemed to have a mental snap. He is aggressive, screaming, paranoid and down right cruel. He has devolved to calling me cunt, b****, accusing me of cheating. I found out he's seeing some doctor outside of the VA and getting weight loss stimulants. He claims he's not taking it but the mood shift is too coincidental. I had to leave the house because he told me the problem is | ""need to {*** off and stay out of his medical care"" Like most women yes I probably am too involved. But he has lots of mental health struggles and can't recognize when he's in crisis.

Tonight he text me ""you aren't sad about the man who's dead because of me"" (Literally have no clue what he's talking about)
This is utter nonsense, I called to check in and he's plastered or high on meds. It's been weeks of me begging him to go to the hospital. I told him I'm going to call the cops for a welfare check and he told me “I’m treacherous” then blocked me.
What do I do? He's a grown man. Do I just break contact?
Please help"
1gig6ue,"In my mid 30's. Been actively trying to get help since 23. Married 4 years now and my wife is talking of leaving she cant handle it. She's already left a few times on the condition I will change. I do my best to treat her the best I can but it's not good enough.

I am emotionally dulled I think. I have anxiety, depression, and flashbacks that interfere with my daily life such as work.

Age 2-18 abused daily by parental units and some siblings (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritually). In my late teens started abusing myself (cutting), and then drugs and alcohol heavily until 26. Have been in recovery for drugs and alcohol almost 2 years now, and have seen countless therapists over the past 10 years. Working on seeing a new one that can do emdr.

Everytime she threatens to leave (she does this by not coming home from work and staying at a friends house a couple days to a week to think things over) it sets my triggers off like you wouldn't believe, feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and fear i will lose my best friend if i can't change fast enough. This triggers even more flashbacks and makes sleeping or work even harder. I just discovered 2 years ago I REALLY need stability in my life and these events really throw everything off balance.

I want to get better and have made some great progress the past couple years but it often seems like theres no end to it.

TL;DR tell me there's some hope, I need some happy success stories with ""becoming a real person"" despite having ptsd."
1h7g73t,"I’m sharing this story in hopes of getting advice and perspective on how to better support my brother, who has been through a lot. He’s 34 now, autistic from childhood, and has had a very challenging life.

# His Background

In college, he befriended some people who seemed good initially but later introduced him to unhealthy habits. They encouraged him to steal money from home to fund their partying. He started consuming alcohol and misusing prescription drugs, likely muscle relaxants and cheap drugs commonly abused in India.

We caught him and ensured he couldn’t access money anymore. However, things took a darker turn. He confessed years later that he visited sex workers and may have been coerced into something worse. There’s evidence suggesting he was exploited — a diary with women’s names and numbers, frequent SIM card changes, and defensive behavior when questioned.

# Post-College Challenges

After an incident where he felt threatened and asked for help, my father intervened. We confronted those who had been harassing him, but the damage was done. He dropped out of college and has since lived at home, unable to work or study.

He has had multiple episodes where he exhibits hallucinations and violent reactions. He imagines people threatening him, argues with them, and acts as if he’s in a fight. His body stiffens, and he loses awareness of his surroundings, shouting or murmuring to himself. These episodes can last for hours or even days.

When not in an episode, he’s timid, avoids decisions, and struggles to interact with others. He’s also had two serious suicide attempts, saying he feels disgusted with himself. Despite psychiatric treatment for over a decade, including medications and rTMS therapy, his condition has only slightly improved.

# Current Situation

Recent psychometric tests show he has mild intellectual disability, autistic tendencies, and traits of schizoid and dependent personality disorders, along with severe depression and psychosis. He also experiences auditory hallucinations — one recurring figure is a man, who he describes as threatening him for money.

Psychiatrists recommend occupational work and gradual reintroduction to daily routines, but he’s afraid of public spaces and struggles with basic interactions. His episodes make employment or education nearly impossible.

Medicines: My country is India. his hallucinations seems to be connected to trauma , as he mentions some names of people we know , but sometimes some other people (not sure if they are imaginary or same people from his college days) These are the medicines being given currently Divalproex, Clozapine, RISPERIDONE and doctor said in case of attack to give Clonazepam

# Our Concerns and Questions

1. **Trauma Resolution**: Some therapists recommend trauma-informed therapy, like EMDR or CBT. Has anyone had experience with these for similar issues?
2. **Medication vs. Therapy**: While medications and rTMS have helped slightly, they seem temporary. Are there better long-term solutions?
3. **Online Therapy**: Considering his difficulty traveling, is online therapy effective for someone with his challenges?Also tried to get some therapist but had poor experience with them , they start scolding him only that he is wasting his life
4. **Predicting Episodes**: He keeps murmuring to himself almost entire day, and then suddenly the attack happens , and sometimes it stays for days or few hrs (duration has decreased to a few hrs post rTMS), it happens more if father is away from him, but difficult to predict when it will happen , anybody with experience of such episodes can you guide us
5. **Societal Support**: In India, mental health resources seem psychiatrist-heavy. Why is therapy underutilized, and how can we find good trauma specialists?
6. Also , he has difficulty in telling the full story still even after 10-12 years, what he sees and who are those people , what they say that triggers him, but seems he knows them, and once tried to tell us that they torture him for money, but when doctors ask him , he keeps saying he is fine , then doctors just prescribe medicine and leave , any way out of this scenario?"
1hn8tda,"Does anyone else experience this? I just feel better at night. No one is usually awake. It's peaceful kinda 

If I wake up from a nap in the afternoon then it's not so great 

My theory is that it's the adrenaline from the nightmares that makes the morning so rough. At least, that's what I've been telling everyone 

Part of my ptsd has to do with business hours. So that might have something to do with it

The other side of this is dreading going to sleep and facing that beast again. It's almost every night in some form. New medication helps with that 

But yeah any advice or encouragement would be much appreciated. 

I was told it could be a wait before emdr begins. Like a prep stage before the left - right stimulation. My therapist said it could be a year "
1edwwzr,"I don't know where to post this but I need help.
I was walking very early morning just a while ago and saw what looks like legs from far but thought it might be a plastic bag. I couldnt stop staring as it really looks like legs, after a moment of thoughts I slowly approached and I was realising that this is an actual body everything around me got blurry. It was an actual dead body of a teenage boy in swimming shorts who must have jumped/fell from his building's swimming pool. Luckily there was a shop open right opposite with 3 guys inside whom I've told about it and they called the police and calmed me down as I was shaking and dizzy.
The shock I am in still is inexplicable, my body is frozen, stiff and numb and I'm very irritable...how do I deal with this?"
1htfa2t,"I’m looking for some advice, I’m feeling extremely helpless and I don’t know what I should do.

My partner has PTSD. It manifests in her yelling at me and saying quite abusive things. The most recent episode was particularly bad. It happened in a public setting and her words were particularly cruel. 

When she came out of it she was extremely upset and disgusted with herself. As far as apologies go, I couldn’t have asked for more. She’s committed to going back to EMDR therapy. 

I love her so much and I want to be there for her, but I grew up in an environment of very intense domestic violence and so the accumulation of verbal abuse in my own relationship has taken a huge toll on my mental health. It essentially puts me back in that time and I feel like I need to escape my current relationship in order to save myself, just as I escaped that prior situation. 

I know it’s not who she is and that she’s not in control when she’s having these PTSD episodes, but it’s to the point where I will read a completely loving and supportive text from her and have an anxiety attack because I feel like I can’t trust her or she’s not a safe person, even if I know rationally that this is not the case. I have spoken to my partner about this and it completely destroys her to know that this is how it’s affected me. I’m disappointed with myself that my past is getting in the way of me moving on and feeling secure again in our relationship. 

I’m just looking for some advice. I desperately want this relationship to work. My next therapy appointment is at the end of February, but in the meantime I really just need something to help me through. It feels like a big mess and I just feel so confused and scared."
1gjtppj,"Hello,

I as diagnosed with PTSD about a year ago. Since then I have gone on the max dose of zoloft and also take a small dose of seroquel. I have a therapist, but don't find it to be helpful, we just mostly chat. I am wondering what kind of therapy has really helped you heal from ptsd. "
1hv1tnj,"I recognize that I have trauma, and I have been getting therapy to cope with the symptoms of anxiety but the fact is that my trauma stems from grief. 
I know only I can help myself from the darkness that I feel from time to time, but it feels lonely. I am someone who longs for companionship to motivate me so if you feel the same, I'd like to befriend you. 
Open to DMs. "
1few7sq,"I am diagnosed and am in treatment for PTSD. I was abused as a child and was hit/punished/yelled at anytime I “complained” or had even basic needs. Because of this, even as an adult, I don’t go to emergency rooms when I should as not to “bother” anyone (I spent three days with broken and fractured fingers because I refused to go to a hospital right away), and I also “gloss over” my symptoms which stops me getting the help I need. This has really hurt me in every aspect of my life because I suffer and suffer silently because I refuse to ever ask for help. I was trained to “cover up” the abuse at home and apparently I’m so good at it I can fool drs etc. Can anyone relate or give me tips on how to acknowledge my own needs and ask for help, especially medically. "
1ggjn73,"I'm in therapy. We have been doing EMDR for a couple of years. A big part of my trauma has been from an Emotionally Immature Parent (great book btw). I have such a hard time moving on. Letting these hurts go. EMDR is helpful, CBT, etc. But I'm looking for more resources on how to practice forgiveness, acceptance, or just Letting go. Something I can listen to, read repeatedly, and put it into action. I don't want to hold on to this anger. Just accept what happened, parent is crazy and still not choosing to work on themselves, past abuse. It's not to excuse the past trauma and what they inflict. It's just to heal, let my body heal from ailments that have been caused from trauma. Not to carry so much of this when moving forward and becoming a parent. Not be so heavy and haunted. Does any of this make sense?

Advice, resources, websites, etc. Are welcome. TIA"
1htwqi6,"I know pretty much everything I need to do to heal and get better, but for some reason I still just freeze, disassociate and procrastinate everything.

It's like in the back of my mind I can't move forward because I don't know who my post-trauma self is, which leads me to nitpick and second guess every little decision in my life so that I don't pick the ""wrong"" path and regret it later, since my past is filled with losses...

Then the lack of accomplishments and time moving too fast sends me into an existential panic, which leads me to numb everything with weed and repeat the cycle.

I struggle with basic self care sometimes cause I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror, and I feel like I'm slowly morphing into an ugly, unkempt monster.

Because deep down I guess maybe I still feel like I don't deserve to be taken care of or loved properly...I look way younger than I really am, so seeing my reflection hurts even more since it looks so childlike. It's an added reminder of what little youth I actually have left...

Like through all the ugliness there's still a small glimmer of my younger, happier self staring back at me, and it tears me up inside like I'm being pulled in opposite directions past my breaking point.

I know I can never go back to who I could've been, but I don't know how to create a ""new"" me while still healing/acknowledging my past. 

If I'm stuck as myself but also I'm not me anymore then who the hell am I, you know? 

(Sorry if that sounds dumb/doesn't make sense to anyone, and I obviously know no one on here can answer that. Maybe it's just my autism making everything too one-or-the-other.)

If there's anyone reading this that's been stuck in a similar mindset, how did you manage to unfreeze yourself and break out of it? I desperately want more than anything to just have at least one happy, productive day with zero overthinking or self loathing for once in my life.

I start EMDR on the 16th but I'm having a hard time waiting that long. Any help or advice would be extremely appreciated."
1hdw6li,I just wish I could stop hating myself. I feel like I've tried everything and nothing helps.I always feel like I will go to hell. I always hate myself. Nothing I do ever changes this. I spend my life trying to be a good person make the right choices be my best self. It's never enough. I always hate myself.
1hjrsxh,"I'm so tired of being on edge constantly. This whole month is a shit show for the last 5 years and it feels like I'll never get better. It feels like I'm letting my family down. That I'm just a burden because I spend so much time in this state of terror. Does anyone else feel like they are never getting out of this state? What do you do when the EMDR is slow going and the medication doesn't really help. How long can this actually go on. I'm so, so tired. My poor family are tired too. Is there hope? "
1gid2uf,"I hate the person I am now, I  drink  to much to shit out flashbacks. Seeing a therapist got to relive the trauma by relaying it in the first person. Does this help? Can you find at least rements of the person you were before? Does this stop the flashbacks? "
1h8r9ge,"Hello!

Disclaimer: I am not looking for psychiatric advice - I’m well aware that people on here can only speak from personal experience. This is what I’m after. I’m also not looking for ‘horror stories’ or from people telling me I should not be on this drug unless I am ‘psychotic’/manic. 

I’ve been taken 100mg Quetiapine (IR, split into two doses) and 60mg fluoxetine for around 1 year, as part of treatment for PTSD, OCD and generalised anxiety. Also having EMDR! 
My mood has been very up and down recently, so my psychiatrist has increased my dose of Quetiapine, and changed from IR to XR.
I’m picking up the prescription tomorrow.

I was just wondering what people’s experiences are of:
- switching from IR to XR
- Increasing their dose - she’s told me I can go up as high as 200mg total, if I feel that 150mg isn’t helping. How would I know if 150mg was enough?
- How do I know if the dose is too high…? I haven’t really had any noticeable side effects on the 100mg (unlike whenever I’ve initiated SSRI’s, and felt awful) - should I expect additional symptoms? 

Thank you in advance! "

1h95tyd,"Hey everyone,

I never post but I read a lot of posts.  For the past few days I’ve had a feeling like something was off. I’ve been doing EMDR and trying medications on top of depression and ADD and anxiety. Today I’ve fought these feelings as hard as I could but I have had this urge to rage and jump up and down. I’ve had intense crying and sobbing. Feeling alone and hopeless. I also dreamt about situations last night. Is this normal or am I falling apart?  Any help is appreciated. "

But now, a couple of days later, I'm starting to feel really scared, and dreading starting treatment. I know it's going to help, I know it's a good place, but I'm just feeling really small and fragile when thinking about it. I have been fighting so long to get here, and now I'm just confused about my feelings I guess "
1hbwb2n,"TL;DR
Car accident caused my wife's PTSD. I want to support her but don't know how to do this whilst being good to myself too. 

Okay so, quick backstory, my wife and I (also female) were in a car accident nearly two years ago now. She developed PTSD from this (as well as a brain injury but this has since gotten much better) but it has brought up a lot of past trauma for her and she has been told she has split into a number of protective personalities.
She went through an extremely difficult upbringing and has only known abuse through her childhood, teenage years and into her adult life. As such, she has only been with abusive partners (she says herself that I am very much an outlier here and I do my best to support her in every way that I can, although it doesn't always feel like enough).

I have also been through therapy for PTSD (EMDR) and for the most part, am MUCH better for it. I still avoid certain triggers but my ability to keep calm and to regulate my own emotions is very much improved. 

She is currently undergoing EMDR therapy too.

I love my wife, so damn much. However, her attitude towards me right now has me on the verge of not knowing what to do. 

I want to support her but I feel as though I am taking less than what I am worth. For instance, she belittles me quite often, invalidates my feelings or straight up says that she isn't there right now and the person who is just doesn't care. She doesn't care if we stay together and she does not care if she upsets me. If I get upset, she tells me it is pushing her away even more. Which then makes me take myself off to feel everything on my own. Something I have always done and was hoping I wouldn't have to do again. 

She then constantly doubts our relationship and tells me she doesn't feel connected to me, but then rejects me most of the time I try to hold her or show her affection. 

I have been in extremely abusive relationships before and have worked on my own self-esteem to get to a point where I am aware when I am being mistreated and I know I am. But I do want to try and make this work, but also to be the support my wife deserves but has never had. 

Additionally, I cannot leave her alone as she is scared that she will die if I am not with her. Which she won't, she has just had many hospital visits since our car accident. I try to build up a little bit of time where I leave the house- to go for a walk for 5-10 mins etc but she gets scared. 

So... please, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I want to support her but I want to support myself too. 
I want to tell her that I deserve better than to be treated the way she does at times, but I also understand that at times, she cannot help how she is acting as she is constantly in defence mode.  

Thanks so much in advance. I am struggling. 
I hope many of you or your families have healed or are on your way. "
1fgs6bs,"I'm a former first responder and I've been experiencing an uptick in Night terrors lately from PTSD. I've been receiving EMDR therapy for about 6 months now which helped for awhile but for the last week my night terrors have returned as a nightly occurrence. They're becoming increasingly more dangerous as my girlfriend has unfortunately witnessed this every night and it's truly ruining my sleep as well as hers. Thankfully she's very understanding. I have an appointment with a Psychiatrist next month as I've been trying to get out of my shell and receive treatment over the last year.

Anything I can do until then to reduce my night terrors/make these less dangerous? I normally keep a pillow between her and I at night to increase distance a bit but it obviously doesn't work all the time. I'm ok with anything home remedy. My work unfortunately is pretty anti substance use though. "
1h5clxw,"I was attacked a year ago in public transit while going to work. My attacker has been arrested and is now serving time in prison. Homeless guy suffering of schizophrenia and wasn’t taking his meds so he was going thru a psychotic period.

The attack was violent, I had jaw reconstruction and lost sensitivity for half of my lower mouth.

I was on sick leave for several months and got a PTSD diagnosis. I have a great therapist who helped me with hypnotherapy and EMDR techniques. I’m now able to use public transit again but with heightened vigilance. I have moments where the attack comes back to my mind and make me feel uneasy; those moments are slowly fading away.

So I think the trauma related to this attack is pretty much under control. However, I’ve just lost interest in pretty much everything.

Work, eat, sleep are pretty much my activities. I feel I’m like a robot routinely executing tasks.

I don’t feel suicidal or anything but just lost interest in life in general. Life just got pretty boring and to be honest, I just accepted this fact and I’m okay with that.

Just for information I’m 46, single and healthy.

I’m still meeting my therapist on a regular basis to help me get close other lifelong traumas. I’m also taking meds (trintellix and Ativan occasionally).

I just feel like I’m existing and crossing out days on the calendar as days go by. Is anyone else feeling this way ?"
1hbb5ng,"After a few traumatic experiences that have left me with PTSD, I’ve been struggling a great deal with forming new relationships. I used to be a very open person. I have always struggled with my mental health, even before the trauma, and I used to open up about it quite a bit. I often feel like I am existing on another plane, if that makes sense (maybe dissociation?). My problem is that so many of my formative experiences, the ones that have contributed to who I am as a person today, are my traumas. And while I do acknowledge that I need to continue working on not tying my identity to my trauma, those experiences have still contributed to what makes me, me— good and bad. So when I’m trying to get to know someone, even casually in groups in my classes, I feel discouraged by the overwhelming idea that because I can’t just randomly share what I’ve been through, that none of these people really know me or ever will. It’s like I constantly feel this heavy weight that is invisible and that I almost wish other people could see. Not for pity or anything, but just so they can really see me. When thinking about forming intimate relationships, I get so scared by the idea of trying to explain it all— not because I think it’ll make the person leave, but because listing out so many events almost sounds like I’m not being truthful; It just sounds like too much.

My therapist and I are going to start working on identifying what being open looks like at different “levels” (that being open isn’t synonymous with sharing my trauma) and understanding that people don’t need to know my trauma to know me or get close to me. I also may begin EMDR, but I am currently a college student, so I think I would need to wait for a time when I can be more present and have space to decompress and heal.

I hope this all made sense, and I really appreciate the help!"
1fi8trn,"Hi All,

TLDR: How do I communicate effectively to my Psych that I need him to include my PTSD diagnosis in all forms I am giving him?

My Psychiatrist diagnosed me with PTSD a few years ago. I was shocked by it, b/c up until then,  I'd only ever been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety.

Well the diagnosis didn't phase me, until I was in PHP, and the memories started creeping in. Queue flashbacks, dissociative states, panic attacks, nightmares, all things I'd brushed off before, except the flashbacks.

It's been a couple of years since then, and my PTSD symptoms have kept me from returning to work, or school, and from doing mundane things to support myself and my son.  I have been in therapy, EMDR, on spravato and other expensive treatments.  The process is incredibly slow.

I have paperwork that will help me financially for the time I have not been able to work, and asked my Dr to fill it out.

The issue is, he only listed GAD and MDD with ICD codes, but no PTSD. I won't be able to continue treatment with him in the next year, so I need diagnoses to be true and consistent, so my treatment doesn't have unnecessary setbacks.

How do I communicate effectively and assertively that I need the PTSD diagnosis included in all of my paperwork from now on?"
1haxqpw,"Japanese men in year end train are so rude and never care someone would have flashbacks

I’m also a middle aged Japanese woman who survived violence.

EMDR has not been as successful as I hoped & I had (I don't even know what to call it anymore) a ""memory"" that keeps attacking me.  The smallest thing that looks like, resembles, kinda could be...a specific thing *(won't be specific because of ghouls that lurk)* is washing the trauma over me again,and again, & again.  Redirecting, music, counting, nothing is helping & I'm struggling not to just panic, puke, rip something apart
.... Help. "
1h2i2id,"I started therapy (with an EMDR therapist but we mostly talk) for r*pes that happened to me as a young adult. My therapist is very cautious about false memories, but had told me that based on my symptoms, there might have been childhood trauma too. A couple of months later, we're pretty certain that there was childhood trauma. Talking to my ""inner child' has helped, but this version of me makes it very clear that it's not allowed to talk about it because otherwise, it will be killed. Every time I feel we get closer to the truth, I become dangerously close to su**ide. 

Here's my question: although I really want to know more about it, I'm learning to accept that pushing myself doesn't help. Have you guys been able to process things without knowing about the trauma itself? How do you handle it? How can you stand not knowing? Any thoughts are appreciated!"

1foneic,"Hello. I'm Jorge, 31 years old from Puerto Rico. I've thought I've been living with untreated PTSD for a very long period of time.

The PTSD is sexual related, I believe. I have extreme laziness, low energy, problems sleeping, overweight, just to name a few.

What should I do now? Get an appointment with a psychiatrist? I'm on depression pills, my next appointment is in December. In the meantime, what other ways are there to treat the condition? Can PTSD be cured naturally? The pills that I'm taking don't seem to help much.

If I have PTSD as I suspect, what medication will be prescribed to me? Just curious.

Edit: I was also heavily bullied in middle and high school. My dad was abusive towards me when I was a child.

I think I have ED as well."

lgzmrwp,"It's honestly changed my life. Incredible, but exhausting."
kumsc7o,"EMDR changed my life. I was putting it off for a long time, and finally gave it a shot.  My therapist worked with me to go through techniques to settle my anxiety and fear if it got to be too much. I cried a lot, didn't always share what came up, but I came out of it feeling much more in control of the trauma, rather than the trauma controlling me. I can talk about things now, and while I still have feelings, I'm not having nightmares or panic attacks anymore."
kukzejf,I’ve been doing EMDR weekly for a year and the results have been incredible. I felt way worse month three and four of treatment since it brought back the really bad memories I had blocked out. I wanted to tap out but I will be forever grateful that I stuck with the treatment. It feels like a complete detox. You’re going to relive those moments to be able to process them but it’s so worth it in the end.

Someone looking for EMDR method maybe have PTSD or trauma. And who wil be find out that it is effective way. But not powerful enough. Me too.

In my opinion, eyes are connected to brain very closely. so when I was moving my eyes I felt pain was relieved. But it is not brain, so there are limits. So I had to find out other method.

At that time, I suffered from severe migraine. Correctly I felt just like someone hand wash my right side brain.

So I thought the fact that I feel pain in my brain it means that there are nerve. And if can I use this nerve, I can solve the problem."

She full stop flipped the convo to that and said it was the root of all my problems, which I can understand where she’s coming from but at the same time I don’t know. I told her I felt that some of my anger was from genetics. She shut that down. 

I’m currently applying to get my masters degree in social work and plan to become licensed later on and want to become a counselor myself. She told me I would NEVER be a counselor if I don’t resolve my trauma. A big emphasis on the never. She told me I had to do EMDR therapy to achieve this. Okay I’m open to it and had looked into it anyways, but she told me I had to see her weekly to do this. I cannot afford it. So basically feeling like my career goals are crushed and it will be impossible to achieve my goals due to my past. I don’t know what support I need, but I feel I have lost respect for my counselor since she kind of destroyed my hopes for the future… because I mean what if I do EMDR and it doesn’t work??? But maybe it’s true. I just don’t know what to do. "
1gi0eto,"I have been seeing my T for trauma and to do EMDR (along with talk therapy and CBT). One thing that makes me really uncomfortable is that whenever I retell my trauma stories or tell her about a difficult experience, she'll just respond with ""okay"" as I'm telling the story and at the end. I know Ts needs to be neutral, not show any emotion/intense reactions and be nonjudgmental when clients disclose trauma, but it makes me feel crazy when I talk about something horrific and I get ""okay"" in response as if I just said I'm thinking of waffles over pancakes for breakfast tomorrow. It makes me feel many things, like she's not seeing the seriousness of what I am sharing or that she's not really listening.

Two months ago, I was telling T about one of my worst traumas: a major medical procedure in childhood where I was on the brink of death. The doctors were very callous towards me during and then after in recovery, even as I, for example, screamed bloody murder and was scared out of my mind and in pain. As I'm telling the story, with each horrible detail, I just get ""okay"" in response and then ""yeah, back then doctors didn't understand the psychological impact medical procedures had on kids."" Nothing even close to ""wow, that was horrible you went through something like that"" or ""it was wrong that they ignored your physical and mental suffering.""

Last month, I told her about the horror of recently going to get bloodwork and how they wouldn't let me lie down to do it so I ended up passing out on the floor. They tried lifting me and whacked my head hard on the floor instead. I managed to get up myself when they shook me awake, only to feel nauseous and vomit all over myself and collapse to the ground. At each point in the story, T goes just goes ""okay"" and then ""we can do some EMDR around that experience."" Again, T registers no shock or surprise at this experience and no reaction when I angrily ranted about the people at the lab, not even acknowledging that they behaved wrongly and inappropriately. I know she isn't supposed to pass judgment, but is she really not allowed to acknowledge that someone was obviously wrong?

Edit: I want to add that the ""okay"" response is for everything I bring to therapy, even if it's not trauma and just shitty experience. Some guy was riding my bumper and honking at me for three miles nonstop so I felt unbearably anxious? ""Okay."" A dentist's office lied to me about how much I'd have to pay out-of-pocket and charged me more? ""Okay."" An extended family member tricked me to get some money from me? ""Okay."" It's become maddening to me that T can never say or validate that those things or people are not right."
kumf438,"Yes it is extremely effective and best of all,  pretty fast compared to talk therapy.
While you do tap into the memories, it is not a long rehashing of the trauma. I give my therapist the basics and the rest of the process is internal. Recounting the trauma is not the focus. They focus on what beliefs about yourself  this trauma has instilled in you and on a scale, how much it affects you. Then you co create a new positive belief that counteracts the negative one. After that, the rest is mostly an internal process while doing the actual eye movement part of the process.  I love EMDR and recommend it"
1aej58m,"Hi - I’m in the process of starting trauma based therapy. I am autistic and have a bunch of comorbidities including cPTSD. 

Has anyone gone through EMDR? How was your experience? Do you think it’s effective or should I consider something like CBT?"
kqxjlva,I’m really glad I saw all these positive comments because my therapist recommended giving EMDR a go for intense trauma but I’ve been hesitant and nervous. I think I might try looking into it
kqt742h,Thank you for posting this. I was recommended to try this by my therapist and wanted some advice and opinions too 🥰
lja5484,"I have experienced a positive benefit from EMDR related to PTSD. Without going into too much detail, I can genuinely recommend [Ashley Whelan](https://www.somaticspiritualtherapist.com) based on my progress."
kukt0n0,"I’ve been doing EMDR with my therapist for my “lesser traumas” for the last year or so, and we just started it for my “major traumas” this week. It’s tough but it’s effective.

I typically feel very drained after a session, mentally and physically. I would recommend clearing at least an hour after your session or maybe more if you have that luxury to give yourself some time and space for processing.

As challenging as it is, it definitely works to reframe trauma and completely change how you think about yourself and your experiences. If your therapist thinks you’re ready, I would give it a shot. If you have a lot of anxiety around it, you could ask if you can start with a memory that’s less troubling for you that would allow you to “test drive” EMDR"
1fsee3k,"Hi, anyone have recommendations for great EMDR practitioners in Manhattan or vicinity? 
Thank you!

#EMDR #PTSD"
1eodzx3,"Hopefully this is not a long shot - has anyone had a positive experience or a recommendation in the New England area for EMDR?

It’s hard to put trust in just anyone, this is such a sensitive and vulnerable position to walk into. Currently not set up with any mental health clinician, but searching!"
1dhkxe9,Most of the recommendations are pretty vague and general
1hydnkd,Does anyone have any experience with Sanctuary Healing in NYC for treatment? My therapist recommended it. I’m really needing emdr therapy and am having a hard time finding availability at reputable places in nyc 
1gebx2h,"Hi everyone. First-time joiner, and a long-time PTSD have-r. TLDR: I have PTSD from childhood trauma I had as a kid from heavy bullying and other unfortunate things that happened. After having a neuro/psych evaluation recently, it's been made official that I have PTSD, along with depression, anxiety, and inattentive ADHD. The doctor who did the neuro/psych evaluation recommended a local facility down the street and I made an appointment with a specific therapist since he was the soonest available one.

Here's where the potential red flags come into play:

* I came in, no one was at the front desk, so I sat down and waited. A few minutes passed by and he came out of his office room (he wasn't seeing anyone). He was a little late but I disregarded it.
* I finally came into the room, and it seemed he wasn't prepared for my situation, so he had to log on to his work laptop, skim through my intake forms (didn't know about my neuro/psych report I sent the facility). And he finally sat down on his therapist chair. Not sure if it's just me, but if I were a therapist, I'd certainly want to prepare myself and read through forms/reports from my patient to know the situation at hand.
* He began asking me questions in typical therapist fashion which I welcome, but the kicker here is that I saw him almost nodding each time I would answer the questions! I think he also noticed that I noticed that he was fighting from falling asleep, but that's definitely not something I wanted to happen, intro meeting or not.

I scheduled an appointment to begin EMDR therapy next week with him, and I mentioned this to my wife and she said I should call to be changed to another therapist. I thought maybe I should give him one shot since he may not be a coffee drinker or something, but that's a little wild to me. I feel like I should switch to someone else, but I'm curious what your opinion is on the matter.

Thanks for your input in advance! I wish everyone the best of luck in your healing journey. 💜


Edit: I called this morning and asked to be switched to someone else. 😄 Thanks again to everyone that had commented and shared your journey with me and the community ❤️"
1gm1qp3,"Hi.  I mainly hang out over in the r/bipolar subs but I decided to come over here to ask you what you thought.  I had many years of childhood abuse and then something happened that shoved me over the edge.   I've had substance abuse (now 4 years sober) problems in my life because of it.  Now I have reached a point in therapy that I want to take the next step.  Im really fucking scared because i have to relive all that trama if I do EMDR.  That is what my psych is telling me.

  
Should I or should I do something else?"
kqsyydt,I just don’t understand how eye movement can move a memory in your brain to somewhere else? I’m willing to try it but I need to know how it works
lepe1pk,"Yes. And sort of. I never got to complete it because I had to fire my therapist for being unethical. But before that, I was making huge strides. From not being about to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night alone, even with someone in the next room, to being able to do that in one session. I was able to go back to work by 1 or 2. Can’t remember. I do not know if it works on complex trauma. I only used it on one of my “simple” traumas."
letafbr,1000 percent worked wonders. You have to be completely honest with yourself about yours triggers while you’re working through them. Don’t downplay how you feel. 
kuntl4p,"In a nutshell, it works. For some, EMDR immediately effective, but my experience took a littler longer. Be patient, consistent and hopefully you will reap the benefits. Good luck!"
lqph03o,"EMDR moderately to significantly decreased my negative associations with each memory I worked on. If you have a tapestry of complex trauma that needs working through, it will take longer than a single event. And if you don't totally know which memories are most relevant to the trauma overall, it may take a little longer. But the idea is you make a list of your most uncomfortable memories and slowly start working through them and webbing out. If it's a hard day and you need to work with an easier memory, do that."
1hi2vxt,"I’ve been out of a job for the past year and a half, relying on my parents at age 30. It’s been really tough to accept, but I have to, cuz I can’t fuckin work. I had bad CPTSD from growing up at the mercy of my mom’s untreated mental illness, but what really broke me was an abusive ex-spouse who ended up having a brain tumor. I just gave out after surviving that. 

I used to be a machine, I worked 40 hr weeks as a line cook and 20 hrs at a gallery/artist’s studio space that I co-own. I loved it. Now I’m barely surviving the 20 hr weeks at the gallery, which makes hardly any money, and relying on my parents. My mom complains about how much work it is supporting me every time I see her and I know I can’t keep doing it for long. I just have no idea what else to do. 

I’m extraordinarily weak, I have some good days but I’m non-functional a lot of the time. I’m doing EMDR and talk therapy and trusting that it will someday get better. I’ve made progress on understanding/accepting what happened to me but I still feel weaker and less resilient every day. I don’t think I can have a service job, or anything with hard hours and forced socialization. 

I keep thinking tattoo artist would be a great path, since I’m already a practicing artist and I’d get to set my own hours, but it takes 2 years of training. My partner thinks I’d be great at a museum, geology/archaeology/paleontology are my special interests and I could talk about any of them all day, but I have no qualifications. I was a math major lol. So I’ve applied to dozens of museum jobs but never gotten one. Only job my math major qualifies me for is insurance adjusting, and I’d rather die than be that evil. I’d love an outdoors job but all NPS or Forest Service jobs require a drug test, and I’m on medical marijuana. I’m just at a loss for what to try, and hoping the community here has some ideas for good jobs for a ptsd-riddled mind haha"
1dtykia,"I was in law enforcement for 21 years having suffered from multiple major traumas during that time. I was first diagnosed with PTSD after 7 years in but stupidly continued working. Finally, after 21 years I could not continue and was medically retired. My diagnosis was upgraded to Complex PTSD with Major Depressive Disorder. That was three years ago. 

Over the past three years, I have made some gains in my symptoms, mostly through medication and EMDR. But still, the symptoms persist. Nightmares, anger problems, inability to maintain normal daily activities. I don't leave the house unless I have to, I can't face crowds or shops. So many things trigger me, especially noise. I can't drive after dark, I can't go outside after dark. 

It's so sad, I spent 20 years protecting the community but now I can't even face the dark.

It's so f\*#king hard. I am so sick of being unable to live a normal life. I want to be normal. I'm concerned that I am in my 40's and have to live the remainder of my life with this shit, with the suicidal thoughts, the constant inability to concentrate to be an effective parent my failure to be present in life, especially with my young children. 

I haven't worked since being medically retired and honestly can't see a path at the moment that will lead to any gainful employment. 

Does anyone else feel like this? Has anyone else been through this and come out the other side? "
